The flowers are incredibly plentiful, despite me being somewhat abusive to the plants (broken stalks, flopped backwards, low sun, crowding). These seeds are incredibly easy to harvest—and so fun, too! Simply pluck brown, shriveled, dry flowers and pull the dry flower tops out of the base of the flower. I swear there's a $3 seed packet's amount PER FLOWER! Talk about infinite seed production!",
