Hi! Iâ€™m Connor and I am a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign studying Computer Science & Linguistics. I am currently on the team as a Software Developer Intern helping add and improve features within the app. Me and my dad have always maintained a vegetable garden each year and have made some great homemade pickles over the years. 

In my spare time I enjoy running and climbing, as well as playing board games and Magic the Gathering with my friends.
