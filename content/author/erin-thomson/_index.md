Hi! My name is Erin and I'm based in Ontario, Canada (growing in USDA zone 5b). I'm a passionate gardener and I've recently turned my hobby into a career. Along with writing for Planter, during the growing season I work at a small-scale organic market garden.

I have a Horticulture Certificate with a focus on Greenhouse Production from the University of Guelph. I'm also a Master Gardener in Training and I volunteer on the Board of Directors for our local horticultural society.

When I'm not writing for Planter or tending the garden, I enjoy hanging out with my husband and our four kitties! 🐈🐈🐈🐈
