Hi! My name is Erin and I'm based in Ontario, Canada (zone 5b). I'm passionate about gardening- especially growing veggies- and I've turned my love of gardening into a career! I have a Horticulture Certificate with a focus on Greenhouse Production from the University of Guelph. Along with the work that I do for Planter, during the growing season I work at a small-scale organic market garden (as well as keeping up with my garden at home!)

Gardening aside, my favorite way to spend time is with my husband and our four kitties! 🐈🐈🐈🐈
