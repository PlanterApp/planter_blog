Hi! My name is Erin and I'm based in Ontario, Canada (USDA hardiness zone 5a, Canadian hardiness zone 6a) . I'm passionate about gardening- especially growing veggies- and I've turned my love of gardening into a career! I have a Horticulture Certificate with a focus on Greenhouse Production from the University of Guelph. I previously worked at a small-scale organic market garden and I've recently relocated to start a market garden of my own! I have also volunteered with my local Master Gardeners chapter and was on the Board of Directors for my local Horticultural Society.

Gardening aside, my favorite way to spend my free time is with my husband and our four kitties!
