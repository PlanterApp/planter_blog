Hi! My name is Erin and I'm based in Ontario, Canada (growing in USDA zone 5b). I'm a passionate gardener who's recently turned my hobby into a career. Along with writing for Planter, during growing season I work at a small-scale organic market garden.

I'm currently working on a Horticulture Certificate through the University of Guelph. I'm also a Master Gardener in Training, and I volunteer for my local horticultural society.

When I'm not writing for Planter or tending the garden, I enjoy hanging out with my husband and our three kitties! 🐈🐈🐈
