Hi ðŸ‘‹. I'm Pam and Iâ€™ve been adding flowers to Planter!

A little about myself- Iâ€™ve gardened my entire adult life, always perennial/herbaceous beds and vegetables when my kids were growing up. Four years ago, I saw a YouTube gardenerâ€™s cut flower beds and immediately decided I needed to be a cut flower farmer. Two years ago, I retired from the University of Connecticut Extension System as a 4-H Educator and dove headlong into growing my [flower farm](https://winterbeegarden.com/).

Now I get to create my own Planter flower garden plans, and you can too!
