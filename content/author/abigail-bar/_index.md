Abby is a senior at the University of Connecticut studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Applied Mathematics. She spent the summer interning at Planter, writing blogs and updating content for the app. She especially loved researching beneficial critters in the garden.

She is very passionate about environmental conservation, and plans to use the skills she gained here at Planter to support her future career in this field. Beyond Abby's education and internship, she loves bike riding, cooking and going to concerts.
