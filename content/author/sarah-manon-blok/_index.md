**Hi beautiful creatures!**

I’m Sarah-Manon. Yup, two names, because I came into this world with enough personality for at least two people, and my parents just rolled with it.

I recently joined the writing staff at *Planter*, and I must say... I'm rooting for this new chapter already! I'm proudly holding it down for the European continent. Born and raised in the lowlands (aka the Netherlands), I now call a little farm at 900 meters altitude in the Black Forest (Germany) my home. With a market garden and some arable land, we’ve started a sanctuary that’s slowly growing into a centre for plant-based food transformation. Super coolsiez, if I may say so.

Besides this out-of-control hobby, I work as a freelance writer and journalist, mostly for organisations accelerating a just food system for humans, nature, and our fellow animals.

The world can feel like a dark and heavy place sometimes. What drives me most in my writing is the hope that I can show others what I see: the wild beauty, the quiet magic, and the stories that bloom in the cracks. There’s so much wonder out there. So many beautiful stories worth sharing.

I hope that after reading one of mine, your heart feels a little more rooted, and a little more open.
