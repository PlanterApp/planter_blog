Hi, I’m Milan, an urban gardener based in Atlanta, GA, zone 8A.

Inspired by the food shortages during the early days of the covid-19 shutdowns, and the memories of my Grandmother’s front yard garden, I started out on a concrete patio growing in containers and fabric grow bags.

After moving to a home with a bigger yard, I’m now growing in raised beds, containers and bigger fabric grow bags.

I am not an expert. What I am is a passionate gardener that loves to research and try gardening techniques geared toward urban gardeners.
