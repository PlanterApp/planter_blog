Hi! I'm Samantha! I live in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, (USDA growing zone 8b), with mild, very wet winters, and hot and dry summers. I’ve loved plants for as long as I can remember. I love growing fruit and vegetables for my family, but medicinal herbs are my favorite plants to grow. My medicinal garden is getting bigger every season.  



Over the years, I have completed several herbalism classes, taught by highly experienced herbalists.  Since 2022, I’ve been learning more about the cultivation of herbs from a local herbalist. Years ago, I studied skin care at a holistic school, so I have a passion for body care from the garden. 





Through Planter, I've been able to combine my love of writing with my love of herbs. When I'm not out in the garden, I like to spend time with my family, cook, make herbal products, and play my Irish whistles.
