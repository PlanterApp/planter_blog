Hi, I'm Peter and I'm the founder and developer of Planter. In 2017, I created the app to make my own garden planning easier, and since then it's helped many more gardeners! I live near the University of Connecticut and unfortunately my yard is way too shady to grow anything, so I have a community garden plot where I grow a little bit of everything, especially salsa ingredients 🍅 🫑 🌶 🧅 🌮 .   

When I'm not in the garden or coding the app, I enjoy hiking with my family, kayaking on peaceful lakes, or enjoying my saltwater reef aquarium 🐠. ..
