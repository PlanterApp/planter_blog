Peter is the founder and developer of Planter. In 2017 he created the app to make his own garden planning easier, and since then it's helped many more gardeners! He lives near the University of Connecticut and unfortunately his yard is way too shady to grow anything, so he has a community garden plot where he loves to grow a little bit of everything, especially salsa ingredients 🍅 🫑 🌶 🧅 🌮 .   
  
When Peter isn't in the garden or coding the app, he enjoys hiking with his wife and kids, kayaking on peaceful lakes, or enjoying his saltwater reef aquarium 🐠.
