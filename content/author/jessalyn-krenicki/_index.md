Hey, I'm Jessalyn, and my pronouns are they/them! I've been content intern here at Planter since the summer of 2022 and help to write Growing Guides, draw up some plant icons, and generally update information in the app! I live near Waterford, CT and attend the University of Connecticut in pursuit of an Environmental Sciences major and an Ornamental Horticulture minor. Though I don't have room for a garden, I keep my room as green as they can and love to learn more about plants whenever I can! My favorite plant so far is my tricolor stromanthe! 🌿🍃🪴

When I'm not working, I throw myself into creative endeavors; making clothes and costumes, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and drawing digital art when I have a chance 🖌️.
