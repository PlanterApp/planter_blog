Hello! My name is Wren and I’m based in South Carolina, USA. I’ve been working professionally as an artist since 2017, and I’m the graphic designer here at Planter! It’s been a lot of fun creating plant icons for the app and colorful images for the social media, I’m excited for everything to be released!

My favorite things to garden are nasturtiums, green beans, peppers, and passionfruit. I’ve been gardening ever since I was a kid and have grown up to appreciate the hobby even more.

When I’m not gardening or designing for Planter, you can find me playing video games, hanging out with my husband and dog, crafting, or researching entomology.
