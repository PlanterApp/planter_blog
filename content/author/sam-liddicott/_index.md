Hello, hello!

I’m Sam! I grew up in the UK and now live in the desert Southwest of the USA. When I’m not indoors, I’m outdoors, and I try to be there as much as possible. Growing flowers is my greatest gardening passion, but I won't say no to some raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, beans, or leafy greens.

I have a certificate in landscape design and have been gardening for over 15 years, from small home gardens to large formal gardens and kitchen gardens.  

My current garden is quite small, so I’m experimenting with growing cactus from cuttings, as they’re particularly resilient to heat and aridity. Cactus fruit makes great syrup, too, though I have yet to produce my own.

I also have some tomatoes and peppers on the go this year as well as some amaranth and loofa ready to plant (2025).

Outside of gardening, you can find me hiking, snapping photos with film cameras (possibly repairing them), or undertaking a design project.
