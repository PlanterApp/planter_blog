Have you ever noticed how plants are like people? They belong to big, messy, fascinating families. Some members are dependable, some are eccentric, and some are the wild cousins you only meet at special occasions.

That’s why we're starting a new series called Plant Families. In each post, we’ll get to know one botanical clan: who they really are, where they come from, and what makes them unique. We’ll peek into their history, their quirks, and their role in our gardens and kitchens.

Because knowing is more than just naming, it’s about connection. When we learn the backstory of a family we don’t just grow them, we grow with them. We discover how deeply woven they are into our cultures, our recipes, and even our folklore.

So buckle up. From the carrot clan to the brassica bunch, from nightshades to grains; this series will introduce you to the plant families you thought you knew, and the ones you’ve never met.

Because knowing is growing! :)
