Cactus and succulent lovers have hundreds of species to explore, and the good news is that nearly all of them can be multiplied from simple cuttings or pups, those small offshoots that form around the base of a mature plant. 

This series walks you through straightforward propagation techniques for the most common groups, along with the pitfalls to watch for as you go. 

Enjoy the process and the new plants that follow.
