We often hear about diurnal (daytime) pollinators because of the vital role they play in our gardens. However, when the sun sets, nocturnal pollinators—moths, bats, beetles, and more—take over. Some plants have evolved specifically for these nighttime visitors, opening their blooms and releasing fragrance only after dusk.

In this series, we’ll explore the troubles they face, how to attract these helpers, and how doing so can strengthen your garden’s health both day and night.
