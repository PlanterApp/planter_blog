Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable in the buckwheat family. Modern culinary rhubarb is a hybrid of *Rheum* species native to Asia and Eastern Europe, with the first widely cultivated modern varieties appearing in England and Scandinavia.

Though rhubarb thrives in temperate climates, it is adaptable, non-invasive (except for Giant Rhubarb, which should be avoided outside its native range), and hardy, making it a reliable staple for gardeners everywhere. In this series, weâ€™ll discuss how to grow rhubarb, how to adapt it for less favorable conditions, and general tips for getting a bumper crop every year.
