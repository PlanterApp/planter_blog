To our US-based readers: we hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with family and friends. Perhaps you even got to enjoy some of your own garden produce on the table!

The holidays are upon us, but for the Planter Team we've still got gardening on the brain! To cap off the season, we've rounded up the greatest hits and misses from our 2025 gardens in the [latest Planter Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyAZ3upFqns&list=PL0q7yhNycgAVVJuHV35xp4OT-H5DtVQKe) episode with Peter, Milan, and Erin.

We've also got some unique new plant additions to tell you about as well as new Growing Guide articles to share:
