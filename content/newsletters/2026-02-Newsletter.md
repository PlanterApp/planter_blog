Do you have your garden plans finalized and your seeds ordered for this year? If not, now’s the time to start planning in <a href="https://planter.garden/app/gardens"> Planter</a>!

As the seed starting season gets underway, we’re launching two handy new plant Quick Info tiles in Planter to help boost your seed starting success: **Germination Temperature** and **Seedling ID**.

Looking ahead to upcoming changes in 2026, we also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHwn8wuP0e8"> new podcast episode</a> out where Peter gives a sneak peek of the upcoming Gardens 2.0 upgrade.

### New Plant Quick Info Tiles


![Screenshot of new Quick Info tiles in Planter](/newsletter-uploads-temp/Quick-info-tiles.png)

We've recently added two new plant Quick Info tiles to help with seed starting:

<b>Germination Temperature:</b> Indicates the optimal soil temperature range for germinating seeds for each plant. The germination temperatures for the most common plants are populated and we will be adding more in the coming weeks.
<br><br>
<b>Seedling ID:</b> When starting seeds outdoors it can be tricky to tell what's a seedling and what's a weed. Use the Seedling ID tile to get a sense of what your seedlings or young plant sprouts will look like (hint: select the tile to expand the image).
