We’re finally seeing a slow temperature decline in the Desert Southwest, which is wonderful. We’ve passed our yearly highs, and although it wasn’t nearly as hot as last year (thankfully), July and August brought far less rain, leaving us below average for the monsoon storms. Below-average years are inevitable, of course, but it’s still disappointing. That said, a wet winter is predicted, which is wonderful. Here’s a brief look at what’s happening in my garden right now.

### Native Flowers

I’ve been slowly introducing native plants as my budget and time allow. I have three Gregg’s Mistflower (Conoclinium greggii), and I’ve already seen about a dozen Queen butterflies visiting them. Mistflower is a keystone species for them, so that’s very exciting. I’ve also noticed tiny native bees darting in and out of the blooms, collecting pollen with surprising precision.

The goldenrod is in full bloom, a sure sign that fall is on the way. I’m hoping to attract migrating Monarch butterflies this year, along with any other visitors that may drop in. Even the occasional hummingbird has been spotted hovering near the goldenrod, curious and quick.

I’ve planted two milkweed plants. They’ve already bloomed and should start spreading in time for next year. Milkweed is a keystone species for butterflies and native bees, so I’m hoping to see more of both.

### Habitats

I mentioned leaf litter in my last entry, and I’ve been continuing that. It’s baby lizard season right now, and I’ve seen dozens zipping around the garden among the leaves — their tiny movements catching the light like living confetti.

I’ve also been scouting locations for bee habitats, which will be my Fall project. It won’t be so hot then, and after trimming all twelve-plus trees, I’ll have a clear sense of both tree and ground habitat spaces. I’m particularly excited about creating little “sunny nooks” under the trees where bees and other beneficial insects can nest safely.

### Seedlings

Arizona’s cool growing season is approaching, and I’ve started some early seedlings: two types of sunflowers, mini-pumpkins, and soon, Mexican native popcorn (the closest native seed I could find) and some lemon balm. 

My loofah has doubled in size and is ready for repotting.

### Long-term Plans

In my quest to reduce water usage, I’ve started another round of native plants: Jojoba, Apache Plume grass, and Fern of the Desert. I also have Penstemon and globemallow ready to plant, along with some winter-rain wildflower seeds. These seeds are unpredictable — you scatter them before any hint of rain and hope they bloom.

This cool season, I’ll likely stick to pumpkins and corn due to space and time constraints. I’m starting a Master’s program, but I might add easy vegetables like cucumbers if time allows. 

This is just a quick update as everything is in an 'inbetween stage' right now. In a few months, there'll be a lot more to show.
