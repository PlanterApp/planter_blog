Today, I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you about our latest feature: the Garden Summary. But first, let me tell you about an incredible conversation we had with none other than Gardener Scott.¬†

If you don‚Äôt know who Gardener Scott is, you should go straight to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GardenerScott) right now and binge-watch his excellent gardening videos. We (Gardener Scott, Erin Thomson, and myself) met up on a rainy day to brainstorm cool features together, talked about the history of the app, and, of course, our brand-new Garden Summary feature. In fact, the Garden Summary feature was inspired by a previous conversation with Gardener Scott and input from the Planter community! So be sure to check out the interview video **\[insert link to Gardener Scott's YouTube video]**.\

Ok, now back to the new feature!

## Garden Summary

As passionate gardeners ourselves, we understand the challenges of planning and managing a garden. To make this a bit easier, we wanted a way to view everything about your garden, quickly and easily.

So, what does the Garden Summary do?¬†

### Plant Quantity Breakdown:

![Screenshot of the Garden Summary plant quantity view.](screenshot-2023-06-06-at-4.10.59-pm.png "The Garden Summary shows exactly how many of each plant you've got in a bed, and breaks it down by variety.")

Ever found yourself in a nursery, scratching your head, wondering how many plants or seeds to buy? Worry no more! With the summary view, we provide you with the exact quantity of each plant and variety in your garden bed. It takes the guesswork out of your shopping list, making sure you get just the right number of plants to thrive in your garden.

### Notes and Events:

In addition to plant quantities, the Garden Summary shows all of your garden‚Äôs notes, allowing you to have a quick and comprehensive overview. At the moment it only includes garden-wide notes, but we plan to add plant-specific notes in the future (once we figure out a nice way to indicate *which* plant the note belongs to).

### Export and Share:

*(Planter Premium feature)*

We know how important it is to have your garden plan easily accessible. That's why we've included the ability to export your Garden Summary to PDF or CSV format. You can print it, save it on your device, or share it with friends and fellow gardeners.¬†

## Next Steps

We never stop improving Planter, and a future update will allow you to compile multiple beds into one summary. This means you'll be able to manage larger garden spaces effortlessly, no matter how many garden beds you have.

But that's not all! We're actively listening to your [feedback](https://planter.garden/requests) and ideas, like the ones shared by Gardener Scott during our interview.

Whether it's managing your seed inventory, enhancing the calendar with reminders and planting tips, or exploring other exciting possibilities, we're committed to evolving Planter into the ultimate gardening companion.¬†

So stay tuned for future updates, and be sure to watch our conversation with Gardener Scott for a candid conversation about the app and what we're plannning **\[insert link to Gardener Scott's YouTube video]**. Happy gardening!
