If you planted a hardneck variety of garlic last fall or late winter, you might have noticed the tops are starting to get curly. These curvy tops are known as scapes. When scapes form, the garlic bulbs begin to create their flowering heads.  Softneck varieties do not have scapes, and their stalk stays soft. Garlic scapes are sought after by professional and home chefs alike because they are delicious and only available for such a short period. Scapes are usually harvested in late spring or early summer before the garlic bulbs are fully mature.

### When to Harvest

Whether or not you intend to use the scapes in your kitchen, removing them from the garlic bulb is a good idea to promote the energy to be sent into growing larger bulbs. Snip scapes just as they are starting to form a half-circle. You can harvest when they are a full circle shape, too, as long as they are tender. If you wait too long, the scapes will become tough, woody, and undesirable.  Scapes can be used right away or stored in the refrigerator. They are stored best in the vegetable crisper drawer or in a wet paper towel. You can also chop the scapes and freeze them for later use for up to one year.

### What to Do With Garlic Scapes

Of course, garlic scapes have a garlicky flavor, but it’s not as strong as a clove. They also have a chive or green onion-like flavor. 

* **Chop** raw scapes and sprinkle them over finished dishes or salads to add fresh garden garlic flavor.
* **Saute** scapes in butter for a delectable stride dish, or add them to stir-fries.
* Chop up and **freeze** little pieces you can add to soups all year.
* Add chopped-up scapes to biscuit dough for **garlicky- biscuits**.
* Make a **pesto** for bread or pasta. 
* You can dry garlic scapes and **powder them** up for a tasty seasoning.

### More Reasons to Harvest Scapes

* Since you can only harvest scapes once a year,  they are seen as a rare treat. You can sell them at your farmer’s markets or local restaurants to earn extra money if you have a hobby farm.
* Like garlic bulbs, scapes have high levels of antioxidants and may support heart or immune system health. 
* If you’re into making floral arrangements and don’t want to eat the scapes, put them in a vase with water and watch them bloom into an interesting bouquet. You can also store the scapes this way for a couple of days until you are ready to use them. 

Garlic scape season is short, so if you’ve got some hard-neck garlic growing in the garden, check to see if you have some scapes and consider trying them in your kitchen this year. Learn more about growing garlic in the [Planter App](https://planter.garden/).
