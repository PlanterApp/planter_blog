What Exactly are Spices?

In broad terms both herbs and spices come from plants, but herbs are usually the fresh leaves. On the other hand, spices are typically dried, and they make use of many other parts of the plant- root, stalk, seed or fruit. Both herbs and spices add flavor to the dish, however herbs are more subtle while spices have stronger flavor. (Some plants, like bay laurel, are woody plants and therefore their leaves fall under spices.)

Companion/Combative Info:

* Onions, while not featured in this post, are a great companion plant to peppers (which make up a large part of our example garden!) Peppers are particularly prone to aphids, and are protected by the pungence of onions and shallots!
* Fennel and dill will play just fine together normally, but if you are looking to harvest the *seeds*, you might want to give them some healthy space. Some accidental cross-pollinating can cause some strange flavors in both.
* Fennel shouldn't be planted by peppers- it releases chemicals in the soil to inhibit the growth of competing plants, so your peppers will pay the price.

Commonly used spices:

* Coriander

  * The seed of the cilantro plant, which is also used as an herb! These seeds are often used in a variety of cultures, including Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Their mild flavor is put to good work alongside other spices in curries, masala, soups, or even pickles. 
  * Heating the seeds before using them will bring out their flavor, so be sure to toast them before grinding them up!
  * When your plant bolts, let it dry out, and then the coriander should be easy to shake from the seed head!
* Fennel

  * Fennel is used usually as a root veggie, but you can also grow it for the seeds and use them as a spice! 
  * Raw fennel seeds have a fresh licorice flavor, but bringing heat to the table sparks brand new flavors. When they're cooked, the seeds offer a more sweet and caramelized flavor.
  * These work well as an interesting sweetener for soups, broths, or oils; all you have to do is simmer them in the dish and strain. Ground, they can be a great rub on meats, particularly pork or lamb.
* Ginger

  * It has a very warm flavor that's widely used in both sweet and savory dishes. Try it ground in baked dishes,
  * Fresh ginger can easily take the show in dishes, due to its strong and bright sweetness. My personal favorite salad dressing is made of carrot and ginger, and is a staple in most hibachi restaurants.
  *
* Peppers

  * Chili peppers and the like can be considered a spice! When dried, their spiciness takes a whole new level, and can be ground up into a powder
* Mustard seed

  * just like coriander, let it go to flower and set seed
* Garlic
* * Dehydrated and powdered/minced, very hearty powerful spice great in curry or most savory dishes. as useful as salt or pepper
* Paprika

  * Not flavorful by itself, but pairs excellently with tomatoes or meat. holds smoked flavor very well if smoked. Made from mild, dried/powdered peppers.
* Rosemary

  * is sort of a grey area, it could really be herb or spice
* Lavender

  * Typically an herb, but you can use the seeds as well! Seeds can be steeped in tea, or you can steep them in milk for lavender ice cream!
* Dill

  * The seeds are excellent for pickling; can be used when ground too, for things like ranch dressing
* Cayenne

  * similar to paprika, but MUCH more spicy. Use very sparingly and don't touch your face when using it!
