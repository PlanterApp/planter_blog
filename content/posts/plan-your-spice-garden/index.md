What Exactly are Spices?\
In broad terms both herbs and spices come from plants but herbs are the *fresh* part of the plant while spice is the dried root, dried stalk, seed or dried fruit of the plant and is almost always *dried* not fresh. Both herbs and spices add flavor to the dish, however herbs are more subtle while spices have stronger flavor. (Some plants, like bay laurel, are woody plants and therefore their leaves fall under spices.)

Commonly used herbs:

* Coriander

  * The seed of the cilantro plant, which is also used as an herb! mild flavor, main ingredient of garam masala
  * Seeds are easy to shake from the seed head after bolting and letting dry
* Fennel

  * bulb fennel is used usually as a root veggie but can be grown for seeds for the spice
  * key ingredient in many baking recipes
* Ginger

  * Great raw, can be used in baked goods when ground
* Peppers

  * Chili peppers and the like can be considered a spice! When dried, their spiciness takes a whole new level, and can be ground up into a powder
* Mustard seed

  * just like coriander, let it go to flower and set seed
* Garlic
* * Dehydrated and powdered/minced, very hearty powerful spice great in curry or most savory dishes. as useful as salt or pepper
* Paprika

  * Not flavorful by itself, but pairs excellently with tomatoes or meat. holds smoked flavor very well if smoked. Made from mild, dried/powdered peppers.
* Rosemary

  * is sort of a grey area, it could really be herb or spice
* Lavender

  * Typically an herb, but you can use the seeds as well! Seeds can be steeped in tea, or you can steep them in milk for lavender ice cream!
* Dill

  * The seeds are excellent for pickling; can be used when ground too, for things like ranch dressing
* Cayenne

  * similar to paprika, but MUCH more spicy. Use very sparingly and don't touch your face when using it!
