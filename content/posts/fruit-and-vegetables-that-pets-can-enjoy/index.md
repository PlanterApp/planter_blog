If you're a gardener with pets, no doubt they spend some time in or near the garden.   While it's essential to do some [pet-proofing](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/pet-proofing/) to your garden, it's also fun to hang out with your pet, just relaxing in the garden.  While your dog or cat probably won't help you with any garden chores, they might love to help you enjoy the harvest.  Our pets can enjoy many fruits and vegetables.  

### What Should Pets Eat?

There are debates about the "right" diet for cats and dogs. In the wild, dogs are omnivores.  They eat meat, of course, but they also eat the stomachs of animals, which are usually full of fermenting plant material. Cats' stomachs are very acidic, so they can survive primarily on meat.  However, plant fiber can help feed the bacteria in cats' stomachs.  Some people feed their pets kibble, some choose wet food, some cook their pet's meals from scratch, and some feed pets raw food. Ultimately, the choice is up to you, but if you want to give your pets some home-grown treats or hope to enhance their health, giving them fruit and vegetables is a good way to share your garden bounty. 

It's important to note that animals' bodies digest and process some plants differently, and small amounts of the wrong food can be harmful. Start with a small amount when giving your pet a new food for the first time. If you are feeding your pets packaged dried fruit, be sure xylitol isn't used as a sweetener because that's toxic to animals. PetMD.com is a good place to find out which fruits and vegetables are safe for cats.  The American Kennel Club has good information regarding dogs.  It's always a good idea to check with your pet's vet before introducing new foods, especially if they have health concerns.

### Dogs

Some dogs love fruit and veggies, and some want nothing to do with them! If your dog wants nothing to do with fresh veggies, you can try cooking them and adding them to your dog's food.  Fruit and veg can be an excellent way to add fiber to your pet's diet, which can be lacking in kibble. According to the AKC, here is some  Safe produce for dogs (not a definitive list): 

Apples- make sure they don't eat too many seeds

Bananas- try adding frozen banana and peanut butter for a doggie smoothie

Blueberries- frozen blueberries are a nice treat on a hot day!

Blackberries

Broccoli

Cabbage

Cantaloupe

Carrots- carrots make a good chew toy

Celery

Cranberries- are on the safe list, but would dogs eat them?

Cucumbers

Green beans- cooked green beans are a hit with a lot of dogs

Ginger-good for upset digestive systems

Peaches

Pears

Peas

Pumpkin-a great base for homemade dog treats and pumpkin seeds have essential fatty acids 

Raspberries

Strawberries

Watermelon



**Fruit and Vegetables to Avoid:**

Asparagus

Avocado

Cherries

Chives

Garlic

Grapes

Green tomatoes

Leeks

Onions



According to the AKC, citrus, spinach, and tomatoes are potentially safe but better avoided. Dogs should only be fed cooked potatoes in small amounts, and they should never be fed green potatoes.





### Cats

Cats don't have sweet taste receptors, so most don't like fruit. Most cats will pick a platter of tuna over a pile of green beans, but if you have a cat with a sophisticated palette, you can try some snacks from the garden. If your cat won't try fresh produce, you can dehydrate the fruit or veggies, then powder them, and sprinkle a little on their food. Safe produce according to PetMD (not a complete list):



Apples

Asparagus

Bananas

Blueberries

Blackberries

Broccoli

Cantaloupe

Cranberries

Cucumber

Ginger-good for upset digestive systems 

Eggplant

Pear

Peas

Peppers

Pumpkin

Raspberries



**Fruit and Vegetables to Avoid:**

Chives

Citrus

Garlic

Green tomatoes

Leeks

Onions

Rhubarb



The same applies to potatoes for cats and dogs: cook potatoes before serving and never feed them green potatoes. 



### Other Pets: 

**Birds:**

Birds can and should eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. This website is a good resource for learning more about what is safe. Avoid garlic, onions, avocados, and head lettuce varieties high in water. 

**Gerbils and Hamsters:**

Be mindful of the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables that hamsters and gerbils eat. Too many snacks high in water can cause gastrointestinal distress. Keep your serving sizes small. These pets can safely enjoy apples, bananas, berries, lettuce, kale, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and more!  



**Rabbits:**

These veggie lovers will eat almost every plant in a veggie garden! However, rabbits are not recommended to eat onions, leeks, garlic, raw potatoes, or iceberg lettuce. Dark and leafy lettuce is okay. 

**Fish:** 

I was surprised to learn that pet fish can eat treats from the garden. You might want to research all the things fish can eat, but some produce they can eat are cucumber, lettuce, carrots, pieces of pumpkin, apples, pears, berries, and zucchini.  Word on the internet says to avoid oranges and watermelon.

Peter, the creator of [Planter, ](https://planter.garden/)gives his fish bolted red lettuce, and they seem to love it! 



Next time you're out harvesting, see if anything sparks your pet's interest.  Their favorite garden treat might surprise you!
