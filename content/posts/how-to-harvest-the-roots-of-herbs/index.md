The autumn season signals a time of preparing. Many of us make sure to get the most out of our gardens by making jams, pickled veggies, sauces, and more.  If you've been growing plants for herbal use, fall means it's time to harvest and dry the roots.    

### When to Harvest Roots

The best time to harvest roots is in the fall when your plant has stopped producing flowers and leaves and has started dying back.  All of the plant's energy is being sent down to the roots to store up before the following spring, and this is when roots are at their best for herbal use. Dandelion roots, for example, have the highest amounts of inulin, a type of prebiotic dietary fiber,  in the fall.  If you can harvest your roots before the first significant frosts, the better. In the northern hemisphere, late September through early November are good times to get digging.  It's also a good idea to harvest when you have the time to clean and process the roots, because roots start to get tough when they dry out. 

With certain plants, it's best to wait to harvest the roots until their second or third year of growth. Some of these herbs are: elecampane, marshmallow root, and parsley.  But you also don't want to wait too long: some roots can grow quite large and get tough and "woody", making them hard to chop. Tough, old, woody roots are also less desirable because they may lack potency. Try to harvest roots before they get to their  4th growing season. If you let them go too long, divide them in half at the roots and replant, this can reinvigorate them.

### Harvesting

The number one rule when harvesting a plant is to ensure you know what you are harvesting. Never harvest a plant if you aren't entirely sure about its identity. If you planted it in your garden, then you most likely know what you have. Be cautious when wildcrafting. It's safe to say most people know what a dandelion looks like. Still, there are "false dandelions," so studying plant identification books is wise. 

 After you've decided on the perfect day to harvest, grab a shovel or a garden fork and carefully dig around the plant, keeping in mind where the roots might be so as not to cut them (some roots grow outwards, so try not to chop them up), going around in a circle gently lifting the plant a little each time you move. Go around the plant until you can lift the root crown.  Some roots can be hard to dig up, and a special tool called a Hori Hori knife can be very handy. Make sure you don't have roots from other plants intertwined into what you want to harvest.

Decide if you are going to harvest all of the roots or just some. If you want to replant, harvest ½ - ¾ of the root system and then replant at the depth you removed it from, removing any old stems or leaves so it can focus on rebuilding at the roots.

### Cleaning

If you harvest roots full of mud, spraying them off with a garden hose before bringing them inside can be helpful. Clean roots gently with water and a vegetable brush, but do not scrub too hard.

### Chopping

 Chop the roots into pieces. It's best to chop roots right away after harvest because some roots start to get tough, making them harder to cut. If you plan on using fresh roots for herbal products, then you should use them straight away. It's best to use fresh roots when making some tinctures. Valerian roots, for example, are preferred by some herbalists to be tinctured fresh.

### Drying

If you plan on drying your roots, you need to do so after chopping them. Chopping them before drying ensures they will dry evenly. You can dry your herbs in a dehydrator, oven, or other method like in a paper bag. With roots, I always prefer to use a dehydrator so I know they are properly dried for storage. It can take a long time to thoroughly dry roots without a dehydrator. 

### Storing

After the roots have been thoroughly dried, store them in a glass container with a lid, like a mason jar or an airtight seal. Store them somewhere at room temperature and out of direct light. A dark pantry works well. Roots can be stored for 2-3 years. Some can be potent longer than that, but that is just a general rule. 

### What to Make With Herbal Roots

With herbal roots, you can make: 

* Tinctures
* Infused oils
* Tea
* Vinegars
* Infused honey
* Syrups
* Condiments 
* Herbal "candy"

### Ideas to Try

* Are you trying to give up caffeine and coffee but still want a hot drink with a rich flavor? Try making a tea out of dried dandelion roots. It won't give you that caffeine rush but it is filled with prebiotic fiber your gut's microbiome loves!
* To make infused honey, warm up some honey in a pot (do not overheat and burn the honey) or place a towel in a slow cooker and place a jar of honey on top of the towel. Add some dried herbs to the honey and let the mix infuse for several hours. Make sure not to leave unattended.  Strain the honey into a jar. Infused honeys are good for toast, mixed into teas, or eaten straight! Some of the most interesting roots to use for honey are elecampane, angelica, and ginger root (technically speaking, we use ginger rhizome, but we call it root). Heating up the honey does mean you risk losing some beneficial properties from the honey, so you can simply add dried herbs to a jar of honey and let it infuse for a couple of weeks. There are also ways to infuse honey with fresh herbs but you must make sure the water evaporates, otherwise you risk fermentation. You can find instructions on how to make infused honey with fresh herbs, on the internet. 
* Long ago, it's said that the first marshmallows were created from the marshmallow plant's roots. You can make an herbal syrup with the roots, which can then be made into the sweet treat we know today. There are vegan recipes and some made with gelatin. Search around for your favorite recipe. 
* Use horseradish root to make your own classic condiment or as an addition to an herbal fire cider recipe.

Sometimes, at the end of a long growing season, the last thing I want to do is get dirty and harvest the roots of my herbs, especially when it's getting colder. But every time I do, I'm so happy I did it. Harvesting roots isn't always glamorous work, but it's definitely rewarding.
