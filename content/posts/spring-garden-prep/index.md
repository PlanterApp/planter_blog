As the weather warms up and the growing season draws nearer, it’s important to not get too excited by the prospect of planting and neglect properly preparing your garden beds! Spring is the perfect time to get the garden ready to handle all the produce it’s going to pump out throughout the season. A well-prepared garden bed will be much more productive, so it’s worth taking the time to do things right from the start.

But what exactly needs to be done to prepare garden beds in spring?

## Warm up garden soil before planting

Even once warm weather arrives, our garden soil can be stubbornly slow to defrost and to reach warm enough temperatures for seeds to germinate. There are a few things you can do to warm up your soil sooner. Again raised beds are typically faster to warm up because the volume of soil is lower and it is exposed to warmer air temperatures. Some gardeners will use black plastic silage tarps to help capture the sun’s heat and warm the soil surface (clear plastic will also warm the soil but it can actually solarize- which can help to kill weed seeds and pathogens but can also temporarily kill off beneficial soil microbes). If your garden was mulched before winter set in, you may want to pull the mulch aside so the soil surface can be exposed to the warmth of the sun (this can also make it easier for seeding). Lastly, you can also apply a layer of well-aged compost onto the surface of the soil to plant into. Just be aware that different crops have different preferred soil temperatures for growing- there’s no urgency to get heat-loving crops in the ground if there is a chance that the soil will not stay consistently warm enough for them.

## Ensure the soil is dry enough to work

Aside from waiting for un-frozen soil you’ll also want to try to avoid working on soil that is too wet which can be a real problem in springtime with rainy weather and potentially snowmelt saturating the soil. Soggy soil should not be walked on or worked as this can cause compaction and degrade the soil structure. One way to get around this and get in the ground faster is to grow in raised garden beds - raised beds allow the excess moisture to wick away and typically you won’t be walking on the surface of the bed itself. Raised beds can be made of wood, concrete, or steel, or you can simply raise the soil level itself if you’re gardening in-ground. Using wood chips in pathways can also help to avoid compaction in the areas you do walk on (and keep your boots from turning into a muddy mess every time you go outside!)

So how do you know when the soil is ready to be worked? Typically you’ll want to wait for a stretch of a few dry days, and when you squeeze the soil in your hand water shouldn't come dripping out.

## Clean up leftover plant debris

Many gardeners will leave at least some plant debris in the ground over winter to help feed the soil and provide homes for overwintering beneficial insects. In most cases you’ll want to remove most or all of this debris in the spring to be able to create a clean, level surface to seed or transplant into. Sometimes you can leave dead plant roots in the ground and simply cut off any above-ground debris, in other cases you may need to pull up the old roots (and compost them!) to have room to seed or transplant properly.

## Tackle problematic weeds

Before planting out your garden beds in spring be sure to take the opportunity to tackle persistent weed problems. If you’re dealing with nasty perennial weeds with extensive root systems you may want to dig them out before plants go in the ground and you’re more limited on how much weeding you can do. If you’re dealing mostly with small annual weeds on the other hand you may want to limit the amount of cultivation you do in spring and instead consider applying a thick layer of well-aged compost as a mulch that can help prevent weed seeds from germinating and reaching the sunlight. Black tarps can help with this as well. Research your problematic weeds to see if there are steps you can take in spring that will save you a lot of weeding headaches throughout the season.

## Add soil amendments

Spring is also the perfect time to work in any soil amendments you intend to use for the season- namely to add organic matter to the soil. Whether you intend to till in your amendments, or you are using a no-till approach, you’ll want to make sure you top up your soil so that it stays productive throughout the season. If there are any particular nutrients lacking you can add them in spring as well- just note that nitrogen in particular can leach away in heavy rains so you may want to wait if there’s a deluge in the forecast. You also may not want to apply nitrogen to perennial plants too early as this can cause a flush of tender growth that could get killed off in a cold snap. If you’ve had a soil PH test done and you know you need to either raise or lower the PH of your soil, unfortunately spring is a little late to apply PH changing agents- but better late than never.

## Set-up garden infrastructure

As a final step to preparing your spring garden bed you’ll want to install any infrastructure that you’re using (e.g., trellises, stakes, arches, cages, irrigation lines) either just before or just after transplanting those crops. If you wait too long to install your infrastructure it can be difficult to delicately build structures around the plants, and you may damage the root systems by poking stakes and tools into the ground.

It can be hard to take the time in spring to properly prepare garden beds before planting - either because we’re eager to get planting or because we’re eager to hurry inside and warm up our hands! But taking the time to ensure the soil is well-prepared and ready for planting will pay huge dividends throughout the season! So don’t feel pressured to get your spring crops in too early- wait for a sunny spring day and spend it getting things growing on the right foot!
