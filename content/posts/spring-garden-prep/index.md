As the weather warms up and the growing season draws nearer, it’s important to not get too excited by the prospect of spring planting and neglect properly preparing your garden beds! A well-prepared garden bed will be much more productive, so it’s worth taking the time to do things right from the start.

But what needs to be done to prepare your garden beds in spring?

## Warm up the soil before planting

Even once the warm weather arrives, garden soil can be stubbornly slow to reach warm enough temperatures for seeds to germinate and plants to grow. There are a few techniques you can use do to warm up the soil sooner:

* If your garden was mulched before winter set in, pull the mulch aside so the soil surface can be exposed to the warmth of the sun (this also makes it easier for seeding). 
* Soil in raised beds will typically warm up faster because the volume of soil is lower and it's exposed to warmer air.
* *Black plastic silage tarps can be used on the soil surface to help capture the sun’s heat and warm the soil. Clear plastic sheeting will also warm the soil but it can actually get hot enough to 'solarize' - which will help kill weed seeds and pathogens but can also temporarily kill off beneficial soil life.* 
* *You can also apply a [thick layer of well-aged compost](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/choose-garden-compost/) onto the surface of the soil to plant into.* 

Be aware that different crops have different preferred soil temperatures for germinating and growing. There’s no rush to get heat-loving crops in the ground if the soil isn't yet staying consistently warm enough for them to grow.

## Ensure the soil is dry enough to work

Soggy soil can be a problem in springtime with rainy weather and snowmelt (in some areas) saturating the ground. Wet soil ideally should not be walked on or worked as this can cause compaction and degrade the soil structure. Soil that is too wet can also cause seeds and seedlings to rot.

Some of the same techniques that can be used to warm the soil can also help the soil to dry enough to plant. Tarps help to protect the soil surface from excess rainfall, and raised beds typically drain faster than in-ground beds. On a side note, even raising your in-ground beds slightly can help improve drainage.

Consider using wood chips in garden pathways to avoid compaction in the areas you frequently walk on (and keep your boots from turning into a muddy mess!)

Lastly, if you are seeing draining issues in spring, you may want to consider amending your soil with compost once it's ready to be worked- adding compost will help your soil achieve optimal drainage

So how do you know when the soil is dry enough to be worked? *Typically you’ll want to wait for a stretch of a few dry days, and when you squeeze the soil in your hand water shouldn't come dripping out.*

## Clean up leftover plant debris

Many gardeners will leave some plant debris in the ground over winter to help feed the soil and provide shelter for overwintering beneficial insects. In most cases you’ll want to remove dead plant debris in the spring to be able to create a clean, level surface to seed or transplant into. Sometimes you can leave dead plant roots in the ground and simply cut off the stems at ground level, amend the soil, then seed or plant around them. If the roots are too thick and this makes planting too awkward, pull them out and compost them.

## Tackle problematic weeds

Before planting out your garden in spring take the opportunity to tackle persistent weed problems. If you’re dealing with nasty perennial weeds with underground root systems you may want to dig them out before plants go in the ground and limit how intensively you can weed. If you’re dealing mostly with annual weeds that are spreading by seed, you may want to limit the amount of cultivation you do in spring and instead consider applying a thick layer of well-aged compost as a mulch that can help prevent weed seeds from sprouting and reaching the soil surface. Research your most problematic weeds to see if there are specific steps you can take in spring that will save you from weeding headaches (/backaches) throughout the season.

## Add soil amendments

Spring is the perfect time to work in soil amendments and build organic matter in the soil. If there are any particular nutrients lacking you can add them in spring as well- just note that nitrogen in particular can leach away in heavy rains so you may want to wait if there’s a deluge in the forecast. You also may not want to apply nitrogen to perennial plants too early as this can cause a flush of tender growth that could get killed off in a cold snap. If you’ve had a soil PH test done and you know you need to either raise or lower the PH of your soil, unfortunately spring is a little late to apply PH changing agents- but better late than never.

## Set-up garden infrastructure

As a final step to preparing your spring garden beds you’ll want to install garden infrastructure (e.g., trellises, stakes, arches, cages, irrigation lines) either just before or just after planting. If you wait too long to install infrastructure it can be difficult to delicately place the structures, wires, and lines around the plants and you could damage the root systems by poking stakes into the ground.

It can be hard to take the time in spring to properly prepare garden beds before planting - either because we’re eager to get planting or because we’re eager to hurry inside and warm up our hands! But taking the time to ensure the soil is well-prepared and ready for planting will pay huge dividends throughout the season! So don’t feel pressured to get your spring crops in too early- wait for a sunny spring day and spend it getting things growing on the right foot!
