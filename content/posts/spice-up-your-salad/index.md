### Arugula

Also known as rocket or rucola, arugula is a green that packs a peppery punch. If you don’t mind salad with a kick you can use arugula as the sole leafy green, but it can make a great addition to mesclun mix where its spiciness is balanced out with lettuce and milder greens. Or, sprinkle it on top of homemade pizza for a gourmet touch (salad meets pizza!)

### Mustard

Mustard packs a good amount of spice- similar to arugula but arguably a notch more intense and with a flavor all its own. Mustard is actually a member of the brassica family which includes broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. Mustard greens are not necessarily green- there are red varieties that add amazing color as well as flavor. Mustard leaves also have unique crispy-juicy stems and ruffled leaves that add an interesting texture to salad mixes. Mustard might be a bit intense as a sole salad green but if you’re needing a change from salad entirely it’s also excellent in stir-fries and soups.

### Baby kale

Kale is often grown for full-sized leaves that can be turned into kale chips, chopped salads, and green smoothies. But if you sow kale plants very densely and cut off the leaves while they are young and tender you have ‘baby kale’ which is a wonderful salad green. Baby kale has the same strong kale-y flavor that fully mature kale does, but the texture is much softer so the leaves are pleasant to eat whole in salads without needing to chop them down first. Also, if you cutting the baby kale leaves and thin out the plants, the remaining plants will grow into fully mature kale so you can harvest large-sized leaves from them (kale is not as prone to bolting as some of the other greens listed).

### Baby chard (and beet) greens

Chard and beets are both related plants that have very similar greens. Chard is often grown for full-sized leaves while beets are often grown for their sweet roots- but both can be seeded more densely and the greens can be cut young for a nice mesclun mix addition. Like beet roots, beet greens (they are often a purple-y red color) have a distinct ‘earthy’ undertone to their flavor- some would even describe it as ‘muddy’ and it doesn’t appeal to everyone. Chard has a more neutral spinach-like flavor but with a really beautiful visual appeal to the leaves with the contrasting stem colors. Beets are likely too deep to be used as a sole salad green and chard likely has too tough a texture- but each add nice depth and pop of color to a salad mix.

### Endive/escarole

While endive and escarole can look like lettuces, they are in fact members of the chicory family (along with radicchio). These greens are most easily described as being bitter- if you do not enjoy a strong bitter flavor they likely will not agree with you. They can be used as the sole green in a salad mix but due to their strong bitterness they are often used as part of a mix to add an interesting counterpoint to the sweeter greens. Endive and escarole is often blanched when growing- that is the growing stem is blocked from receiving sunlight to keep it a beautiful white color. They can also be grilled first which adds a depth of flavor that works really well with the bitterness.

### Bonus: Nasturtiums

Nasturtiums are often added to edible gardens for their beautiful color, to attract pollinators, and as excellent companion plants. But did you know that all parts of the nasturtium plant are also edible? They have a mild peppery taste and they make for a stunningly beautiful salad with the flowers and the leaves combined together. They look super-sophisticated on the plate, but they are so easy to grow in the garden!
