Between parties, parades, family meals, and festivities, gardening might not be top of mind at this time of year! Even so, any avid gardener will be secretly (or not-so-secretly) hoping to find some gardening gifts under the tree.

If you're struggling to find a gift for the gardener that has everything fear not- weâ€™ve got gifting ideas for even the most geared-out gardener!

## Garden marker

![Artline garden marker](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qSi7DvHJL._SX522_.jpg "Image source: Amazon")

Regular â€˜permanentâ€™ markers usually become not-so-permanent in a garden! Between the rain and the UV rays from the sun, invariably the ink will fade. The [garden marker](https://www.amazon.com/Artline-Garden-Marker-Outdoor-Resistant/dp/B07DWGJGCJ/r) stands up to the elements so it can be used for writing garden labels or labelling seedling trays without fear of losing track of which plants are where. Makes a great stocking stuffer for any gardener!

## Hori hori knife

![A.M. Leonard hori hori knife](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VRI6HurOL._AC_SX679_.jpg "Image source: Amazon")

A [hori hori knife](https://www.amazon.com/M-Leonard-Deluxe-Leather-Sheath/dp/B00DEKR9MA/) is an extremely versatile garden tool. It can be used for both digging and slicing- useful when transplanting, dividing plants, and maybe even cutting out those too-far-gone weeds (not that we ever let them get that badâ€¦right? ðŸ˜…) The measuring guide on the side makes it easy to determine the correct depth when planting. This particular model from A.M. Leonard even comes with a handy twine cutter built in!

## Speciality garden hoes

Garden hoes come in all kinds of shapes and sizes to tackle different weeding and gardening tasks. While it might feel like overkill to have more than one garden hoe, it really does make a difference to have â€˜the right tool for the jobâ€™...and if you have any sizable area to weed almost anything is better than hand weeding! [Lee Valley has a great selection](https://www.leevalley.com/search#q=hoe&t=product-search-tab&sort=relevancy&layout=card&numberOfResults=25) of garden hoes but one that is especially versatile is the [trenching hoe](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/garden-care/cultivators/74394-lee-valley-trenching-hoe?item=PD236).

## Garden cart

While a garden cart might not be a glamorous garden gift, they are amongst the most practical gardening tools. Save time and backaches by wheeling around large amounts of compost and mulch rather than lugging them in a wheelbarrow. Load multiple trays of seedlings to avoid making multiple trips back-and-forth while planting. While there are many brands of garden carts available on the market, the [Gorilla cart brand](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Carts-Poly-No-Flat-Tires/dp/B084NTR8V6/) is well-known for its strength and durability.

## Paper weed barrier

What gardener wouldnâ€™t love to be given the gift of less weeding? This [paper weed barrier from Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/planting/tarps-and-covers/115508-weed-barrier?item=HP107) is an effective, eco-friendly way to cut down on weed pressure in the garden. It's thicker than standard rolls of brown paper so it wonâ€™t tear easily. Simply roll out and cut the desired length, bury the edges with soil, then cut holes or slits to plant into.

Monty Don might be the United Kingdomâ€™s guru of all things gardening, but his excellent advice goes beyond the borders of Britain.Â  [The Gardening Book](https://www.amazon.com/Gardening-Book-Accessible-Houseplants-Vegetables/dp/0593797795/) is a treasure trove of Montyâ€™s horticultural expertise and includes information on small-space gardening, houseplants, shrubs, trees, and more.Â  It is filled with beautiful pictures and, like all of Montyâ€™s books, is a joy to read.Â 

## The Healing Garden by Juliet Blankespoor

If you want to get a gift for someone who has taken an interest in herbalism, then [The Healing Garden](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Garden-Cultivating-Handcrafting-Remedies/dp/0358313384) is a must-have book.

[Sili Seedling trays](https://www.sili-seedlings.com/) are the perfect gift for the gardener who loves reducing, reusing, and recycling!Â  Since the trays are made from silicone, they can be used repeatedly. They are easy to clean and can be sterilized in the dishwasher.Â  They come in a lot of cool colors and sizes, too.Â 

## Personalized engraved seed storage box

A custom-engraved seed storage box can be the perfect gift for the gardener with all the tools, gadgets, and seeds.Â  This wooden box can be personalized and will make any gardener smile.Â  There are many seed boxes on Etsy, but[ this shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1402419289/personalized-engraved-seed-storage-box?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=seed+box&ref=sr_gallery-1-3&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1&content_source=20fbc58a427d8394f3c5f8df41b17582b03a8857%253A1402419289&search_preloaded_img=1&organic_search_click=1) has many 5-star ratings.

## Custom Garden Sign

![A metal sign with shovels and hand rake. The sign says "Grandma's Garden".](https://ucarecdn.com/068fbd12-fba4-408a-a5dc-3b9add506a36/il_1588xN.6166211094_b40s.webp "Image source: [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/942657754/custom-garden-sign-personalized-garden)")

What do you gift the gardener who already has all the tools and equipment they need? A decorative sign so they can proudly proclaim that it's their garden! I gifted a few of these last year from this [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/942657754/custom-garden-sign-personalized-garden) and they turned out great.
