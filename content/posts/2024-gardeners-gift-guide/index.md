Between parties, parades, family meals, and festivities, gardening might not be top of mind at this time of year! Even so, any avid gardener will be secretly (or not-so-secretly) hoping to find some gardening gifts under the tree.

If you're struggling to find a gift for the gardener that has everything fear not- weâ€™ve got gifting ideas for even the most geared-out gardener!

**Garden marker**

Regular â€˜permanentâ€™ markers usually become not-so-permanent in a garden! Between the rain and the UV rays from the sun, invariably the ink will fade. The [garden marker](https://www.amazon.com/Artline-Garden-Marker-Outdoor-Resistant/dp/B07DWGJGCJ/r) stands up to the elements so it can be used for writing garden labels or labelling seedling trays without fear of losing track of which plants are where. Makes a great stocking stuffer for any gardener!


**Hori hori knife**

A [hori hori knife](https://www.amazon.com/M-Leonard-Deluxe-Leather-Sheath/dp/B00DEKR9MA/) is an extremely versatile garden tool. It can be used for both digging and slicing- useful when transplanting, dividing plants, and maybe even cutting out those too-far-gone weeds (not that we ever let them get that badâ€¦right? ðŸ˜…) The measuring guide on the side makes it easy to determine the correct depth when planting. This particular model from A.M. Leonard even comes with a handy twine cutter built in!

**Speciality garden hoes**

Garden hoes come in all kinds of shapes and sizes to tackle different weeding and gardening tasks. While it might feel like overkill to have more than one garden hoe, it really does make a difference to have â€˜the right tool for the jobâ€™...and if you have any sizeable area to weed almost anything is better than hand weeding! [Lee Valley has a great selection](https://www.leevalley.com/search#q=hoe&t=product-search-tab&sort=relevancy&layout=card&numberOfResults=25) of garden hoes but one that is especially versatile is the [trenching hoe](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/garden-care/cultivators/74394-lee-valley-trenching-hoe?item=PD236).

**Garden cart**

While a garden cart might not be a glamorous garden gift, they are amongst the most practical gardening tools. Save time and backaches by wheeling around large amounts of compost, mulch rather than lugging them in a wheelbarrow. Load multiple trays of seedlings to avoid making multiple trips back-and-forth while planting. While there are many brands of garden carts available on the market, the [Gorilla cart brand](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Carts-Poly-No-Flat-Tires/dp/B084NTR8V6/) is well-known for its strength and durability.

**Paper weed barrier**

What gardener wouldnâ€™t love to be given the gift of less weeding? This [paper weed barrier from Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/planting/tarps-and-covers/115508-weed-barrier?item=HP107) is an effective, eco-friendly way to cut down on weed pressure in the garden. It's thicker than standard rolls of brown paper so it wonâ€™t tear easily. Simply roll out and cut the desired length, bury the edges with soil, then cut holes or slits to plant into.
