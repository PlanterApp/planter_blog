Between parties, parades, family meals, and festivities, gardening might not be top of mind at this time of year! Even so, any avid gardener will be secretly (or not-so-secretly) hoping to find some gardening gifts under the tree.

If you're struggling to find a gift for the gardener that has everything fear not- we’ve got gifting ideas for even the most geared-out gardener!

Regular ‘permanent’ markers usually become not-so-permanent in a garden! Between the rain and the UV rays from the sun, invariably the ink will fade. The [garden marker](https://www.amazon.com/Artline-Garden-Marker-Outdoor-Resistant/dp/B07DWGJGCJ/r) stands up to the elements so it can be used for writing garden labels or labelling seedling trays without fear of losing track of which plants are where. Makes a great stocking stuffer for any gardener!

What gardener wouldn’t love to be given the gift of less weeding? This [paper weed barrier from Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/planting/tarps-and-covers/115508-weed-barrier?item=HP107) is an effective, eco-friendly way to cut down on weed pressure in the garden. It's thicker than standard rolls of brown paper so it won’t tear easily. Simply roll out and cut the desired length, bury the edges with soil, then cut holes or slits to plant into.
