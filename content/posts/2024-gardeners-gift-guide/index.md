Between parties, parades, family meals, and festivities, gardening might not be top of mind at this time of year! Even so, any avid gardener will be secretly (or not-so-secretly) hoping to find some gardening gifts under the tree.

If you're struggling to find a gift for the gardener that has everything fear not- we’ve got gifting ideas for even the most geared-out gardener!

What gardener wouldn’t love to be given the gift of less weeding? This [paper weed barrier from Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/shop/garden/planting/tarps-and-covers/115508-weed-barrier?item=HP107) is an effective, eco-friendly way to cut down on weed pressure in the garden. It's thicker than standard rolls of brown paper so it won’t tear easily. Simply roll out and cut the desired length, bury the edges with soil, then cut holes or slits to plant into.
