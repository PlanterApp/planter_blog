### When to Start

The vibrant bloom of wildflowers marks the arrival of spring in the Southwest, the warm, sunny season in between the nippy winter and the scorching summer. March is the ideal time in the Southwest to transplant warm-season vegetables or start quick-growing seedlings for a full harvest by June.

### What to Plant

Focus on quick-maturing vegetables that can handle high temperatures like those from the nightshade (tomatoes, peppers) and squash families (cucumbers, melons, summer squash) as well as herbs, especially rosemary, oregano, thyme, chives, and culinary sage**.** When sourcing plants, look for desert heirloom varieties, hybrids, or regular cultivars that suit the warm, drier climate. Mediterranean plants generally do well in the Southwest; however you should always check before you buy.

If you’re looking for a wider variety, you can expand your search to plants that mature quickly. Many plants that mature for harvest between 30-90 days (up to 70 days is optimal) can survive a Southwest spring, particularly if given sufficient shade and water.

### Where to Plant

The summer sun is hot, and the high UV index in the desert can do a number on plant tissue. To minimize heat stress, focus on planting in areas that receive shade in the afternoon. Raised beds made from fired adobe bricks are excellent in the desert because of their high thermal capacity (they regulate heat well) and will keep the soil cooler than the dirt around it. 

Another consideration is *sunken garden beds,* which are as equally effective as raised adobe beds for keeping the soil cool. Look for a future article on this and how to create them.

Take temperature readings in your garden before choosing where to plant, and observe where shade falls throughout the day as well. Areas near concrete walls or driveways will typically be hotter than those closer to trees or adobe buildings. Be mindful of planting too close to trees however, as they will compete for water and stunt your vegetable growth.

### How to Create Shade

Not every spring is mild, and if you don’t have naturally shaded areas in your garden, you can easily create some. 

First, you’ll need some shade fabric, or shade cloth (the name can vary). A shade rating around 60% is ideal so that the sunlight is reduced but not entirely blocked. Shade fabric often comes pre-sized, and with grommets to attacht it easily (we recommend this option for ease) so you may be able to buy one that fits your garden bed perfectly, or you can buy a bulk roll and trim to size as needed.

Installing it is very straightforward. The tunnel method, where the fabric is draped over curved canes, or like a triangular tent is excellent for low growing plants, and the fabric can be attached to the canes or structure using zip ties. Alternatively, you can used tall garden canes or fence posts to elevate the fabric to cover taller plants such as tomatoes. For larger posts, a screw can be drilled into the top or side of the post, and the fabric secured over it For garden canes, zip ties are very handy once again.

### Reducing Water Loss

Mulch is essential in Southwest gardens. A 1-2 inch layer around (but not directly on top of) seedlings and young plants helps trap moisture while maintaining airflow. Mulch can lower soil temperature by as much as 20°F, which is a huge benefit in the desert. When using mulch, be mindful of small scorpions that may use it as refuge if it becomes too damp; citrus peel or planting lavender with your veg will help to deter them.

Drip irrigation works well in Arizona. Water early in the morning to reduce evaporation and keep roots healthy. Check plant health regularly and provide supplemental watering on especially hot days. If needed, water again in the early evening with at least 2 hours of daylight left.

### Multi-Storey Gardening

Layering plants at different heights helps create a cooler microclimate, reduce water loss, and maximize space. You may have heard of the **Three Sisters** method—corn, beans, and squash—which works well in hot climates. In this system, tall corn provides shade, beans fix nitrogen in the soil, and squash spreads across the ground to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

You can apply these principles to other plants in a Southwest garden:

* **Tall plants (e.g., tomatoes, sunflowers, okra)** provide shade for heat-sensitive crops.
* **Medium-height plants (e.g., peppers, bush beans, eggplants)** benefit from dappled sunlight beneath taller plants.
* **Low-growing herbs (e.g., basil, oregano, creeping thyme)** help retain soil moisture while deterring pests.
* **Vining plants (e.g., cucumbers, melons, pole beans)** can be trained to climb, reducing ground heat exposure.

By carefully layering plants, you can create a self-sustaining ecosystem that protects your crops from excessive heat and evaporation while improving soil health. The Planter App can help you plan your garden properly.

### Choosing the Right Soil

Desert soil is often dry and low in nutrients but drains well. Mix it with compost to improve moisture retention and fertility. A good starting ratio is 2/3 compost to 1/3 native soil. Adding in decomposing mulch such as hay is excellent too.

### Wrapping Up

Gardening in the desert Southwest isn’t tricky, but a little planning goes a long way. Choosing the right plants and location will help you enjoy a productive harvest year after year. Fresh tomatoes off the vine complemented with garden-grown oregano make for delicious additions to a summer salad.
