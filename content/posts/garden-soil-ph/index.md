There’s a few obvious things that plants need to thrive- soil (or a soilless growing medium), sunlight, water, and nutrients. What might not be as obvious is the importance of soil pH for plants. If your soil does not have the right pH for the plants that you’re growing, you’ll need to amend it to have a successful veggie garden. But before we dive into how to change soil pH, let’s look at what soil pH is and why it matters for the health of your plants.

## What is soil pH and why does it matter?

pH stands for potential hydrogen, and in the context of the garden it is a measurement of the amount of hydrogen ions in the soil (technically in soil solution). pH is measured by a numerical scale ranging from 0.0 to 14.0, although soil pH will never reach the extreme ends of the scale.. Lower numbers are acidic, higher numbers are alkaline (aka ‘basic’), and a pH of 7.0 is neutral- neither acidic nor alkaline. It’s a bit counter-intuitive but the higher the pH the less hydrogen exists in the soil and the lower the pH the more hydrogen there is in the soil. Having the right soil pH for your plants matters because nutrient availability in the soil is dependent on soil pH. Even though your soil might contain enough nutrients for your plants, if the pH is either too acidic or too alkaline the nutrients will either be bound too tightly or too loosely for plants to use. Depending on which nutrients a particular plant needs more or less of, that plant will prefer a soil pH that makes those particular nutrients more readily available.

## What pH should my soil be?

The optimal soil pH for growing fruits and vegetables is generally between 6.0 - 7.0, with some exceptions. To check the preferred pH for the particular plants you are growing, refer to the new Soil pH Quick Info Card in [Planter](https://planter.garden/gardens)! This will help you know if you have the optimal soil pH for the plants you want to grow. <<screenshot>>

## How can I test my soil pH?

The best way to test your soil pH is to send a soil sample to your local extension office or to another reputable soil testing laboratory. You’ll likely want to test multiple areas in your garden as the pH can vary from bed to bed, and be sure to follow the lab’s testing instructions carefully for accurate results. While lab tests can be a bit pricey, you’ll learn lots of valuable information about your soil and how to amend it for the best results.

If you can’t afford a lab soil test or you don’t want to wait for the results to come back, another option is to buy a [soil pH meter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soil+pH+meter) or a [home soil test kit](https://www.amazon.com/Luster-Leaf-Rapitest-Soil-1602/dp/B01HQXF0PS). There are even ways to do DIY soil pH tests with materials you might already have at home. While at-home home testing isn’t as precise as lab testing, if done properly you should at least get an indication of whether you have highly acidic or alkaline soil that could cause your plants to struggle. If your at-home test suggests there’s an issue, you’ll want to follow up with lab testing before adding any amendments to raise or lower the soil pH.

## Changing your soil pH

### How to raise soil pH

If you only need to raise your soil pH very slightly, applying compost can help to bring the pH into an optimal range. Compost has an ideal pH for growing veggies and working it into your soil can help to buffer your soil pH. If your soil is fairly acidic and you need to raise the pH significantly, you’ll want to apply lime to the soil. There are different types of lime available - garden lime (aka agricultural lime) is calcium carbonate which adds calcium to the soil as well as raising the pH. Dolomitic lime adds magnesium. If your soil has excess calcium but is deficient in magnesium you’ll want to choose garden lime, and vice-versa if your soil is deficient in magnesium.

It typically takes some time for soil microbes to work the lime in and raise the soil pH so you’ll want to apply lime in the fall for the soil to be ready for planting in spring.

### How to lower soil pH

If your soil is only slightly alkaline, incorporating compost can help to nudge the pH into the optimal range (it has the same buffering effect as with slightly acidic soils). To acidify your soil more significantly, you’ll need to apply sulfur. Note that there are different types of sulfur available that can contain added nutrients, but unless you know that the nutrients are specifically lacking in your soil it’s best to use elemental sulfur. It does take time for the sulfur to acidify the soil so it’s best to apply it in fall for spring planting.

Keep in mind that changing your soil pH isn’t a one-time event; in many cases you’ll need to keep monitoring it and adding amendments as necessary to maintain the recommended pH range. If you’re struggling to optimize your soil pH, gardening in raised beds or containers can be a good alternative as it’s easier to achieve and maintain the right pH in a contained spot. This can be especially helpful for plants with unique pH needs, such as blueberries which require an unusually acidic soil that many other plants will not tolerate.

While soil pH often isn’t top of mind, it’s undoubtedly one of the most important factors for healthy plants. Whether you’re starting a new garden or troubleshooting an existing garden, pay attention to the soil pH to ensure your garden will thrive!
