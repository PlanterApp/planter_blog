Greeting fellow gardeners!

You've [asked for it](https://planter.garden/requests/4ceDKBnMKejh5Epov3EM) and we've listened! Today, we're excited to announce that we’re rolling out flowers in Planter!

My name is Pam, and I’m one of the newest members of the Planter team. I’ve been adding flowers to Planter over the last few months, and I'm thrilled to finally share them with you!

A little about myself- I’ve gardened my entire adult life, always perennial/herbaceous beds and vegetables when my kids were growing up. Four years ago, I saw a YouTube gardener’s cut flower beds and immediately decided I needed to be a cut flower farmer. Two years ago, I retired from the University of Connecticut Extension System as a 4-H Educator and dove headlong into growing my flower farm.

Now I get to create my own Planter flower garden plans, and you can too! Today we're adding over 3 dozen new flowers to the app. Look for more flowers through the upcoming months, and blog posts about flowers, [herb gardens](https://blog.planter.garden/series/herbs/), and especially native and pollinator gardens. I hope you find the flowers that you love to garden with in the plant library. If you don’t see your favorite flower, you can r[equest it in the app](https://planter.garden/requests), and as always, you can [add your own custom plants](https://info.planter.garden/plant-information/create-plants/) to your Planter garden(s).

How exciting to be gardening with you this summer!
