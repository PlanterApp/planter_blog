## JalapeÃ±o

JalapeÃ±os are a classic pepper pick, but for good reason! They are versatile in the kitchen- adding a spicy kick to Mexican-style dishes- but the plants are also super-easy to grow and \*extremely\* prolific! Just a few plants should provide you with plenty of peppers. And if you find yourself overrun with pepper harvests, no sweat- jalapeÃ±os are delicious when pickled and can also be pre-chopped and frozen. Iâ€™ve had good luck growing the Jedi cultivar from Johnnyâ€™s but there are many good seed options out there!



## Lunchbox



*Recommended by Erin*

You might not have come across lunchbox peppers in the grocery store before but once you taste them youâ€™ll be hooked! These tiny little sweet peppers are perfect for fresh snacking and veggie trays, although they can be cooked as well. The compact plants will be packed with oodles of peppers- so youâ€™ll have plenty to eat in the garden harvest. While the green snack peppers are edible, it's worthwhile to leave at least some of them ripen fully to red, orange, and yellow for the best sweet flavor.



## Shishito

If you like to live on the wild side, these peppers are for you; they are the Russian roulette of peppers. Nine out of ten are perfectly mild, then BAM, youâ€™re hit with spice. I didnâ€™t know this when I first grew them and only found out after offering some to my partner, who does not like spicy food. What are the chances that the one she ate would be the spicy one ðŸ˜…! These peppers are delicious snacking peppers or are great grilled. When I grew them in 2021, they were extremely abundant and although very delicious, I couldnâ€™t keep up. One or two plants should yield plenty for the average family.



## Habanada

*Recommended by Peter*

Do you love the flavor of habanero peppers but canâ€™t take the spice? Try growing habanada peppers, which supposedly offer the delicious flavor of habanero peppers without the zing. Iâ€™m growing these for the first time this year and will report back if they live up to the hype!

## Cayenne

The easy-going cayenne is my pepper of choice. Hotter than jalapenos, and less spicy than habaneros, cayenne sits in the middle, with medium heat, and a lot of flavor. These bushy plants usually produce a lot of peppers which are perfect for drying.  You can dry and grind up cayenne and use it to flavor just about any food.  Like all hot peppers, cayenne is full of capsaicin, the component that gives peppers their heat. If you are looking to add more medicinal plants to your garden, cayenne is a great addition. Cayenne has been used as an herb by Native Americans for many years.  Studies show that the capsaicin in cayenne may help soothe aches, enhance heart health, and more. So, if you want more capsaicin in your diet without a super intense burn, try growing some cayenne! 

## Ancho (Poblano) Peppers

*Recommended by Milan*

What poblano peppers lack in heat, they more than make up in flavor. Especially when roasted in a cast iron skillet. The smoky taste adds dimension to your weeknight dishes. When used fresh they are referred to as poblano peppers but once dried they are referred to as ancho peppers. Poblano peppers thrive in warm weather and love full sun. Provide consistent watering, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged. Harvest poblanos when they turn dark green and glossy. They usually mature in 60-80 days after transplanting.
