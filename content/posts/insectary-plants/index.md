If you've already read our article "[Pest Hunters: Beneficial Predatory and Parasitic Insects](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/beneficial-predatory-insects/), you know that there are many beneficial insects that prey on garden pests. Better yet, we can attract these pest-killers to our gardens by planting 'insectary plants'.

What makes a plant an insectary plant? Insectary plants provide food sources and shelter for beneficial insects, which attracts them and encourages them to stick around your garden. You might be wondering: ‘if beneficial insects eat pests, why do they need plants for food?’ In many cases it’s the beneficial insects' larvae that prey on insect pests while the adults feed mainly on pollen and nectar. That is why many insectary plants tend to be flowers or flowering herbs. In the case of herbs like cilantro and dill it's important to leave at least some of the plants to bloom if you want to attract beneficial insects, rather than just harvesting the leaves then pulling the plants out when they start to flower.

If you want to incorporate insectary plants in your garden, plan to have a variety of plants with different bloom times to keep the beneficial insects there all season long. Aim to plant as many insectary plants as is possible with the space you have and be sure to plant them close to the plants you want to protect. If they're too far away from your main garden the beneficial insects and their young may not make the trek over.

We've compiled a list of some common insectary plants and which beneficial insects they attract:

# Insectary plants

### Ammi

**Scientific name:** *Ammi majus* | [Click to search on Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=ammi+majus&sca_esv=4c501b42f1890102&source=hp&biw=1528&bih=738&ei=MT8BaOepEZWy0PEPqqCBuAI&iflsig=ACkRmUkAAAAAaAFNQYpOnE_a-PVAxy3s5opX44xXziF0&ved=0ahUKEwinhvez0N-MAxUVGTQIHSpQACcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=ammi+majus&gs_lp=EgNpbWciCmFtbWkgbWFqdXMyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESO0dUKMMWKsbcAB4AJABAJgBSaABvQSqAQIxMLgBA8gBAPgBAYoCC2d3cy13aXotaW1nmAIKoALXBKgCAMICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICChAAGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQABiABBgKmAMBkgcCMTCgB6QwsgcCMTC4B9cE&sclient=img&udm=2)[](<>)[](https://www.google.com/search?q=ammi+majus&sca_esv=4c501b42f1890102&source=hp&biw=1528&bih=738&ei=MT8BaOepEZWy0PEPqqCBuAI&iflsig=ACkRmUkAAAAAaAFNQYpOnE_a-PVAxy3s5opX44xXziF0&ved=0ahUKEwinhvez0N-MAxUVGTQIHSpQACcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=ammi+majus&gs_lp=EgNpbWciCmFtbWkgbWFqdXMyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESO0dUKMMWKsbcAB4AJABAJgBSaABvQSqAQIxMLgBA8gBAPgBAYoCC2d3cy13aXotaW1nmAIKoALXBKgCAMICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICChAAGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQABiABBgKmAMBkgcCMTCgB6QwsgcCMTC4B9cE&sclient=img&udm=2)

In a [study of insectary plants from the University of Connecticut](https://draft.insects.lab.uconn.edu/vegetable-ipm-research/), *Ammi majus* was found to attract the highest number of beneficial predatory and parasitic insect families amongst all plants studied. Ammi was also the only plant in the study that attracted two types of parasitic wasps- braconids and ichneumonids. Ammi generally blooms in spring and early summer.

### California poppy

**Scientific name:** *Eschscholzia californica*

![A cluster of bright orange California poppy flowers growing in the ground](https://ucarecdn.com/9ce7ab59-8a47-472b-bfe9-4bb8d555ccbe/California-poppy.jpg)

California poppies are native to the western United States and Mexico. They are highly attractive to syrphid flies and can also attract minute pirate bugs. California poppies bloom from early spring to summer, depending on the climate. In warmer areas they are perennials, but in colder climates they are grown as annuals.

### Catnip

**Scientific name:** *Nepeta catria*

![A close-up shot of white blooms on a catnip plant](https://ucarecdn.com/6dab05b2-0d58-4983-82a1-f7a2f1496d3a/Catnip.jpg)

Catnip does double duty when comes to pest control. Not only does it attract beneficial nectar-feeding insects such as syrphid flies, but it also produces compounds that have been shown to repel pests such as aphids, squash bugs, and others. Catnip is an extremely aggressive spreader that also self-seeds prolifically, so you'll want to keep it contained and grow it in an area where it cannot easily self-seed. Catnip usually blooms from late spring to mid-summer, depending on the variety.

### Chamomile

**Scientific name:** *Matricaria chamomilla*

![Many white chamomile flowers with yellow centers, with a syrphid fly on one of the flowers](https://ucarecdn.com/6bcdf451-1e33-451a-beff-8ae42622b9f9/Chamomile.jpg)

Studies have found chamomile to be highly attractive to syrphid flies as well as parasitic wasps. Chamomile may also help attract lady beetles, lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and tachinid flies. Chamomile blooms from spring right through to fall, providing a valuable season-long food source for beneficial insects.

### Cilantro

**Scientific name:** *Coriandrum sativum*

![Flowering cilantro with a bee and a hoverfly on the white flowers](https://ucarecdn.com/72479e25-2174-43be-9d05-af6aa01bddd1/Cilantro-flowers-Planter.jpg)

Cilantro goes to flower readily especially when warm, dry weather arrives in late spring to summer. While this can be disappointing if you're growing cilantro for it's leaves, it's a boon for attracting a variety of beneficial insects such as syrphid flies, tachinid flies, lacewings, lady beetles, and minute pirate bugs. Plus you can let cilantro form seed then harvest the seeds either to make coriander or to plant!

### Dill

**Scientific name:** *Anethum graveolens*

![Yellow dill flowers with a syrphid fly on them](https://ucarecdn.com/7e81b70f-f251-46f8-a5ba-554767841a5f/Dill-flowers.jpg)

While dill is technically a biennial it often flowers in the first season, depending on the variety and when it was planted. Dill is attractive to syrphid flies, lacewings, lady beetles, and parasitic wasps. You might also find green-black-and-yellow caterpillars on your dill plants. These are black swallowtail butterfly larvae, and while they do eat dill (and related plants) they rarely cause major damage. It's best to leave them be! 

As a bonus, dill may also have a repellent effect on aphids, cabbage loopers, squash bugs, and other pests. 
Plus dill readily self-seeds if the flowers are left to form seed heads!

### Lavender

**Scientific name:** *Lavandula*

![Purple lavender blooms with a tiny bee on them and other flowering plants blurred in the background](https://ucarecdn.com/a63ebfcb-3166-4630-8951-b92b8d8ec3a5/Lavender.jpg)

English lavender is attractive to syrphid flies and lady beetles. Lavender is a drought-tolerant plant once established that does not like 'wet feet', although it will flower best if not left to completely dry out. The scent of lavender, while appealing to many of us, may have a repellent effect on mosquitos, moths, and other pests.

### Marigold

**Scientific name:** *Ammi majus* | Click to search on Google Images

In a [study of insectary plants from the University of Connecticut](<>), *Ammi majus* was found to attract the highest number of beneficial predatory and parasitic insect families amongst all plants studied. Ammi was also the only plant in the study that attracted two types of [parasitic wasps](<>)- braconids and ichneumonids.

### Mint

There are certainly many more insectary plants than the ones listed here! Research is just beginning to help us understand how particular plants can be best used for natural pest control, and there are almost certainly native plants in your local area that can help to attract beneficial predatory and parasitic insects to the garden. Planting an array of flowering plants in the garden is a great way to beautify the space, while providing potential benefits to your edible crops!
