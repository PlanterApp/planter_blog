If you've already read our article "[Pest Hunters: Beneficial Predatory and Parasitic Insects](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/beneficial-predatory-insects/), you know that there are many beneficial insects that prey on garden pests. Better yet, we can attract these pest-killers to our gardens by planting 'insectary plants'.

What makes a particular plant an insectary plant? Insectary plants provide food sources and shelter for beneficial insects, which attracts them and encourages them to stick around your garden. You might be wondering: ‘if beneficial insects eat pests, why do they need plants for food?’ In many cases it’s the beneficial insects' larvae that prey on insect pests while the adults feed mainly on pollen and nectar. That is why many insectary plants tend to be flowers or flowering herbs. In the case of herbs like cilantro and dill it's important to leave at least some of the plants to bloom if you want to attract beneficial insects, rather than just harvesting the leaves then pulling the plants out when they start to flower.

If you want to incorporate insectary plants in your garden, plan to have a variety of plants with different bloom times to keep the beneficial insects there all season long. Adding just one or two flowering plants is likely not enough to attract an army of predatory insects; aim to plant as many insectary plants as is possible with the space you have. Be sure to plant insectary plants close to the plants you want to protect- if they're too far away from your main garden the beneficial insects and their young may not make the trek over.

We've compiled a list of some common insectary plants and which beneficial insects they attract:

# Insectary plants

### Ammi

**Scientific name:** *Ammi majus* | [Click to search on Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=ammi+majus&sca_esv=4c501b42f1890102&source=hp&biw=1528&bih=738&ei=MT8BaOepEZWy0PEPqqCBuAI&iflsig=ACkRmUkAAAAAaAFNQYpOnE_a-PVAxy3s5opX44xXziF0&ved=0ahUKEwinhvez0N-MAxUVGTQIHSpQACcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=ammi+majus&gs_lp=EgNpbWciCmFtbWkgbWFqdXMyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESO0dUKMMWKsbcAB4AJABAJgBSaABvQSqAQIxMLgBA8gBAPgBAYoCC2d3cy13aXotaW1nmAIKoALXBKgCAMICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICChAAGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQABiABBgKmAMBkgcCMTCgB6QwsgcCMTC4B9cE&sclient=img&udm=2)[](<>)[](https://www.google.com/search?q=ammi+majus&sca_esv=4c501b42f1890102&source=hp&biw=1528&bih=738&ei=MT8BaOepEZWy0PEPqqCBuAI&iflsig=ACkRmUkAAAAAaAFNQYpOnE_a-PVAxy3s5opX44xXziF0&ved=0ahUKEwinhvez0N-MAxUVGTQIHSpQACcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=ammi+majus&gs_lp=EgNpbWciCmFtbWkgbWFqdXMyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESO0dUKMMWKsbcAB4AJABAJgBSaABvQSqAQIxMLgBA8gBAPgBAYoCC2d3cy13aXotaW1nmAIKoALXBKgCAMICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICChAAGIAEGLEDGArCAgcQABiABBgKmAMBkgcCMTCgB6QwsgcCMTC4B9cE&sclient=img&udm=2)

In a [study of insectary plants from the University of Connecticut](https://draft.insects.lab.uconn.edu/vegetable-ipm-research/), *Ammi majus* was found to attract the highest number of beneficial predatory and parasitic insect families amongst all plants studied. Ammi was also the only plant in the study that attracted two types of parasitic wasps- braconids and ichneumonids. Ammi generally blooms in spring and early summer.

### California poppy

**Scientific name:** *Eschscholzia californica*

![A cluster of bright orange California poppy flowers growing in the ground](https://ucarecdn.com/9ce7ab59-8a47-472b-bfe9-4bb8d555ccbe/California-poppy.jpg)

California poppies are native to the western United States and Mexico. They are highly attractive to syrphid flies and can also attract minute pirate bugs. California poppies bloom from early spring to summer, depending on the climate. In warmer areas they are perennials, but in colder climates they are grown as annuals.

### Catnip

**Scientific name:** *Nepeta catria*

![A close-up shot of white blooms on a catnip plant](https://ucarecdn.com/6dab05b2-0d58-4983-82a1-f7a2f1496d3a/Catnip.jpg)

Catnip does double duty when comes to pest control. Not only does it attract beneficial nectar-feeding insects such as syrphid flies, but it also produces compounds that have been shown to repel pests such as aphids, squash bugs, and others. Catnip is an extremely aggressive spreader that also self-seeds prolifically, so you'll want to keep it contained and grow it in an area where it cannot easily self-seed. Catnip usually blooms from late spring to mid-summer, depending on the variety.

### Chamomile

**Scientific name:** *Matricaria chamomilla*

![Many white chamomile flowers with yellow centers, with a syrphid fly on one of the flowers](https://ucarecdn.com/6bcdf451-1e33-451a-beff-8ae42622b9f9/Chamomile.jpg)

Studies have found chamomile to be highly attractive to syrphid flies as well as parasitic wasps. Chamomile may also help attract ladybugs, lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and tachinid flies. Chamomile blooms from spring right through to fall, providing a valuable season-long food source for beneficial insects.


### Cilantro

**Scientific name:** *Coriandrum sativum*

There are certainly many more insectary plants- this is just a starting point! There are also likely native plants in your local area that can help to attract beneficial insects to the garden. There are plenty of statements made online about potential insectary plants, but you may want to check trusted sources such as Extension Office websites to see if these claims have any evidence. Planting an array of flowering plants in the garden is a great way to beautify the space, while providing potential benefits to your edible crops!

Research is just beginning to help us understand how particular plants can be best used for natural pest control.
