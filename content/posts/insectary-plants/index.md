Most gardeners are aware of the critical role that pollinators play in the garden (and the world). We build pollinator-friendly gardens that help provide food, water, and shelter for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. But did you also know that there are also beneficial predatory insects that can help keep the pest populations in your garden in check? We can attract these pest-killers to our gardens by planting “insectary plants”.

Insectary plants are plants that provide food sources for beneficial insects. You might be wondering: ‘if beneficial insects eat pests, why do they need plants as food?’ Often it’s the larva of beneficial insects that prey on insect pests, but the adults feed on pollen and nectar. That is why many of the insectary plants tend to be flowers or flowering herbs (which is also a win for attracting pollinators!) In the case of the herbs, it is important to let some of the plants bloom, rather than harvesting them all, if you want to attract beneficial insects.

Research is just beginning to help us understand how particular plants can be used for natural pest control. Keep in mind that using insectary plants to control pests is a medium-to-long-term strategy. If you have a heavy pest infestation taking steps to attract predatory insects won’t fix the immediate problem. Plan to add insectary plants to your garden right from the beginning of the season and make sure you have a wide array of plants with different bloom times to keep the beneficial insects there all season long. Also, planting insectary plants is not a one-and-done- you’ll want to plant them each year to help maintain the populations of beneficial insects For more information on specific beneficial predatory insects and the pests they prey on, see [Pest Hunters: Beneficial Predatory Insects](https://blog-preview.planter.garden/posts/pest-hunters-beneficial-predatory-insects/). It is important to be able to identify beneficial predatory insects versus pests. Some predatory insects can look quite threatening but they are actually garden helpers that you don’t want to kill!

One lonely flowering plant in your garden is likely not enough to attract an army of predatory insects and keep them there. Plant as many insectary plants as possible and intersperse them in and around your crop plants (although be sure not to cram things in so densely that the plants are competing for space and nutrients).

While some predatory insects are available to purchase, they are typically used in enclosed commercial greenhouses. Even if your garden is set up to attract beneficial insects, many of them may fly on to other areas which can be a waste of money. Additionally, there are some ethical considerations with how these insects are collected and what happens to them when potential food sources are gone. Generally, it’s better to do what you can to help attract local predatory insects rather than to purchase them.

Some of common insectary plants with proven benefits include:

### Ammi

### Basil

### California Poppy

### Catnip (in a container!)

### Chamomile

### Cilantro

### Dill

### Fennel

### Lavender

### Marigold

### Mint

### Oregano

### Parsley

### Rosemary

### Savory

### Sunflowers

### Sweet alyssum

### Thyme

There are certainly many more insectary plants- this is just a starting point! There are also likely native plants in your local area that can help to attract beneficial insects to the garden. While there are lots of online claims about potential insectary plants, you may want to verify with trusted sources such as Extension Office websites to see if these claims are backed up by research. If you’re not too worried about scientifically proven benefits, feel free to experiment with a variety of plants. Incorporating diverse, flowering plants is a great way to beautify your garden while providing potential benefits to your edible crops as well!
