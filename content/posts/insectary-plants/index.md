We can attract these pest-killers to our gardens by planting “insectary plants”.

Insectary plants are plants that provide food sources for beneficial insects. You might be wondering: ‘if beneficial insects eat pests, why do they need plants as food?’ Often it’s the larva of beneficial insects that prey on insect pests, but the adults feed on pollen and nectar. That is why many insectary plants tend to be flowers or flowering herbs. In the case of herbs like cilantro and dill it's important to leave some of the plants to bloom if you want to attract beneficial insects, rather than just harvesting the leaves then removing the plants when they start to flower.

Research is just beginning to help us understand how particular plants can be best used for natural pest control. Plan to add insectary plants to your garden right from the beginning of the season and make sure you have a wide array of plants with different bloom times to keep the beneficial insects there all season long. One lonely flowering plant in your garden is likely not enough to attract an army of predatory insects and keep them there. Plant as many insectary plants as possible and intersperse them in and around your crop plants (although be sure not to cram things in so densely that the plants are competing for space and nutrients).

Some of common insectary plants with proven benefits include:

### Ammi

### Basil

### California Poppy

### Catnip (in a container!)

### Chamomile

### Cilantro

### Dill

### Fennel

### Lavender

### Marigold

### Mint

### Oregano

### Parsley

### Rosemary

### Savory

### Sunflowers

### Sweet alyssum

### Thyme

There are certainly many more insectary plants- this is just a starting point! There are also likely native plants in your local area that can help to attract beneficial insects to the garden. There are plenty of statements made online about potential insectary plants, but you may want to check trusted sources such as Extension Office websites to see if these claims have any evidence. Planting an array of flowering plants in the garden is a great way to beautify the space, while providing potential benefits to your edible crops!
