As evenings turn cooler, many summer crops start to fade. Tomatoes slow down, beans get tough, and cucumbers struggle. But just when the garden seems ready to rest, another group of plants takes center stage: the Brassicas. If autumn has heroes, it’s them. (Especially here in Germany, hello sauerkraut!)


### **A Family With Many Faces**

As a triplet myself, I’ve always thought of my family as pretty big. But it’s nothing compared to this one. You may know the brassica family as just cabbages and cauliflowers, yet the Brassicaceae clan is much larger than most people imagine. It has around 370 genera and over 4,000 species, making it one of the most important plant families in both our gardens and our kitchens.

Some members include:

* Kale and collards 
* Broccoli and cauliflower 
* Brussels sprouts
* Kohlrabi
* Radishes and turnips
* Bokchoy, mizuna, arugula (yes really!), mustard greens 

So, amazingly, many of these vegetables all come from one of the 4,000 species: Brassica Oleracea. They are carefully bred of centuries to emphasize different parts of the plant. Leaves, stems, buds, flowers, roots, they are all transformed into unique crops, yet bound by family ties. 

### Why Autumn is Their Season 

Brassicas thrive when the air is cool and crisp. They dislike the stress of high summer heat, but as soon as autumn rolls in, they grow strong and sweet.

In fact, many brassicas taste even better after the first frost! Why, you ask? Here’s the cool part: cold weather triggers chemical changes that turn starches into sugars, making kale sweeter and Brussels sprouts less bitter. So instead of bundling up in warmer clothes like we do, they literally change their chemistry. Plants are way cooler than us (kidding… kinda).

In short, where summer crops retreat, brassicas shine. They are the bridge between seasons, carrying us from the abundance of late summer into the steady rhythm of winter harvests. 

### Fun Facts to Share Around the Dinner Table

* The brassica family includes crops, herbs and even ornamentals! 
* * Canola oil (a staple cooking oil worldwide) comes from a brassica too: Brassica napus.

  * * Brassicas are also called “crucifers” because their four-petaled flowers look like a cross. 
* This fam is a nutritional powerhouse! They are packed with vitamins C, K and folates. Plus compounds called glucosinolates that give them their characteristic mustardy bite.  And, and, and this is also the compound that protect the plant from pests (and ironically, they’re also linked to health benefits for us)! You should totally flex this glucosinolates-fact at dinner. 
* Broccoli and cauliflower are essentially the same plant, just bred for different flower structure.

### Caring for Brassicas in Your Garden

**Soil & Feeding**

* Brassicas are hungry plants! Give them fertile, well-drained soil enriched with compost. 
* They thrive with steady moisture and benefit from a balanced organic fertiliser. 

**Planting Time** 

* Late summer is perfect for sowing fast growers like arugula, mustard and radishes for autumn salads. 
* Kale, cabbages and brussels sprouts can be transplanted now and will be ready to harvest as autumn deepens. 

**Frost is a Friend**

* Don't fear the cold, frost improves the flavor! With a little protection (row covers, mulch) many brassicas will carry you right into winter. 

**Pest and Protection** 

Okay, this is an important one. Brassicas are vulnerable to diseases. The most serious is clubroot, a soilborne parasite that causes swollen roots and stunted growth. Once present, it can survive in the soil for up to 20 years! Because all members of the brassica family are susceptible, it's very important to rotate them as a group. 

Rotation helps because it: 

* Breaks pest and disease cycles
* Lets the soil recover nutrients
* Keeps plants healthier and yields stronger

### A Simple 4-Year Rotation Plan

Here's a beginner-friendly rotation cycle you could use: 

Year 1 -> Brassicas (so your cabbage, kale, broccoli, etc.)

Year 2 -> Legumes (peas, beans): add nitrogen to soil

Year 3 -> Roots & Alliums (Carrots, beets, onions, garlic)

Year 4 -> Fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash)

Then back to year 1 with brassicas. The key: Don't plant brassicas in the same soil two years in a row. 

### Using Planter's Growing Guide

To make rotation simple, use the Planter app's growing guide: 

* Each crop is tagged with its plant family, so you know which ones count as brassicas.
* Planting calendars help you plan sowing and transplanting at the right time.
* Care tips keep track of spacing, feeding and watering needs. By marking wat you've planted in each bed, you can easily see when and where to rate crops next season. 

When summer crops fade, brassicas take over. They’re tough, nutritious, and often taste best in the cool of autumn. By giving them fertile soil, protection from pests, and a good crop rotation, they’ll reward you with months of fresh harvests.

Happy gardening!
