Gardener Scott is one of the foremost gardening experts on YouTube, and in his new book [Gardener Scott's Guide To Raised Bed Gardening](https://www.amazon.com/Gardener-Scotts-Guide-Raised-Gardening/dp/0228105366) he introduces gardeners to every aspect of raised bed gardening.

When gardeners see bugs in the garden sometimes alarm bells go off, but it's important to also learn about the 'good guys'- beneficial insects that help keep garden pest populations in check. In [Good Bugs For Your Garden](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/good-bugs-for-your-garden_allison-mia-starcher/417446/#idiq=1961291&edition=3280149) Allison Mia Starcher teaches gardeners all about these garden superheroes and how to attract them to your garden.

Jesse Frost is a market gardener (small-scale farmer) who runs the No-Till Growers channel and Grower's Daily podcast on YouTube. Even if your giftee isn't gardening on the scale of a market gardener, 'Farmer Jesse's' book [The Living Soil Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Soil-Handbook-Ecological-Gardening/dp/1645020266) is a must-read for any gardener interested in building healthy garden soil and ecological gardening.

# Seed Starting and Indoor Growing

## Chestnut Potting Tools

![Chestnut set of 2 potting tools on a wooden background](https://www.leevalley.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.contentstack.io%2Fv3%2Fassets%2Fblt050573defaf102e3%2Fblt0bf2d2c24676b2a5%2F669c269f3af6f7ca8e8301e8%2Fhttps_assets.leevalley.com_Size5_10126_DB140-d-0027.jpg%3Fbranch%3Dproduction&w=1080&q=75 "Image source: Lee Valley")

These [little potting tools](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/potting/115936-set-of-2-potting-tools) might not look like much, but they are the handy-dandiest tools for seed starting and potting up plants! The pointed tool is perfect for dibbling seeding holes, picking up tiny seeds, and for pricking out young seedlings. The flat-ended tool is perfect for arranging and flattening soil in trays or pots. These tools are the perfect stocking-stuffer for the gardener on your list!

## Soil Blockers

![20-cell handheld soil blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/dw/image/v2/BJGJ_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dwd81f175d/images/products/tools/09528_01_20blockmkr.jpg?sw=800&sh=800 "Image source: Johnny's Selected Seeds")

If the gardener on your list hasn't given it a go yet, they're sure to appreciate being introduced to [the benefits of soil blocking](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/revolutionize-your-seed-starting-with-soil-blocking/). Soil blocking is space-efficient, can help reduce plastic use, and encourages healthy seedlings. To get started the [20-cell handheld soil blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/20-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-9528.html)* is great for starting smaller seeds. For potting up the smaller blocks or for starting larger seeds the [4-cell handheld blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/4-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-7862.html) is ideal (better yet pick up both!)

*\*At the time of writing, the 20-cell handheld soil blocker at Johnny's seeds is less expensive but backordered. Lee Valley has a [similar blocker](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/propagation/seed-starting/69004-soil-cube-mold) that is slightly more expensive but appears to be in stock.*

## Microgreens Grow Kit

If your recipient is expecting a white Christmas this year, give them the gift of growing indoors with these [Back to the Roots microgreens kits](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Roots-50041-Microgreens-Gardening/dp/B085PWHM5J)! Growing delicious, nutritious microgreens [can be a bit of a learning curve](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/grow-microgreens-at-home/) but these kits make it super-easy for them to get started. Each kit includes a mix of different organic seeds, compostable starting trays and growing medium, as well as access to "Green-Thumb Text Support" for detailed microgreen growing instructions!

If your giftee has some open space in their garden, gifting them native wildflower seeds is sure to inspire them to create a natural garden oasis. Native wildflowers are beautiful, low-maintenance, and key for attracting pollinators and beneficial insects to the garden. For two great native seed sources to try: SFinBloom has [stunning native wildflower mixes](https://www.sfinbloom.art/shop) tailored to a variety of different regions and Roundstone Seeds also has a great selection of [beautiful region-appropriate mixes](https://roundstoneseed.com/13-landscape-and-design-mixes).

If the gardener in your life is interested in supporting all types of garden wildlife, gifting them a [bat house](https://www.bigbatbox.com/collections/bat-houses) (yes, a bat house!) is a unique gift idea. Why a bat house for a gardener? Bats are amazing hunters of all kinds of garden pests and in some areas certain bat species can also help pollinate plants!

# Gardening Tools and Gear

![Grampa's Weeder in action with a weed in it and a foot beside it](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-3c8l9ljcjn/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/22637/22819/65p0101_grampasweeder_main__21992__49573.1735233113.jpg?c=1 "Image source: Garrett Wade")

Any gardener would appreciate receiving a tool to make weeding a little bit easier!

## Muck Boots

![Green MUCK Women's Muckster II Mid Boot](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UzPjoSzZL._AC_SY575_.jpg "Image source: Amazon")

Being a gardener sometimes means getting out in the garden even on days with less-than-perfect conditions. [Muck boots](https://www.amazon.com/stores/TheOriginalMuckBootCompany/page/C467EE9D-7F8B-4C34-83D9-3A164D3F5D13?lp_asin=B07QL3DKQD&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto) are the perfect all-weather boots for doing just that. They're flexible and breathable so they can be worn when it's warm-ish out but they're also tough and waterproof for damp days (there are also winter boots available). As a thoughtful design detail, the boot outsoles are self-cleaning so your giftee won't be stuck walking around the garden on mud-clump-moon-boots.

## Waterproof Pruning/Wash Gloves

These might not be the cutest gardening gloves around but these [waterproof pruning and wash gloves](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/clothing/gloves/62005-protective-pruning-gloves) are rugged, tough, and get the job done! They're 100% waterproof so they're great for washing down carrots, lettuce, and other garden harvests. Not only that, they're prefect for working with pokey and irritating plants like zucchini and parsnips, so you can save your giftee from scraping and roughing up their hands and arms.

## Rolling Work Seat
