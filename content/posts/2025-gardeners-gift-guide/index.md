Gardener Scott is one of the best-known gardening experts on YouTube, and in his first book [Gardener Scott's Guide To Raised Bed Gardening](https://www.amazon.com/Gardener-Scotts-Guide-Raised-Gardening/dp/0228105366) he introduces gardeners to every aspect of of raised bed gardening. Not only does the book have detailed information on the benefits of raised bed gardening and how to start your own raised bed garden, it's also chock-full of great gardening advice  that's relevant to all gardening styles.[](https://www.amazon.com/Gardener-Scotts-Guide-Raised-Gardening/dp/0228105366)

## Waterproof Pruning/Wash Gloves

These might not be the cutest gardening gloves around but these [waterproof pruning and wash gloves](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/clothing/gloves/62005-protective-pruning-gloves) are rugged, tough, and get the job done! They're  100% waterproof so they're great for washing down carrots, lettuce, and your other garden harvests. Not only that they're prefect for working with pokey and irritating plants like zucchini and parsnips, so you can save yourself from battle wounds on your hands, wrists, and arms.[](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/clothing/gloves/62005-protective-pruning-gloves)

## Chestnut Potting Tools

These [little potting tools](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/potting/115936-set-of-2-potting-tools) might not look like much, but they are the absolute handy-dandiest tools for seed starting and potting up plants! The pointed tool is perfect for dibbling seeding holes, picking up seeds (with a bit of moisture) and for pricking out tiny seedlings. The flat-ended tool is perfect for arranging and flattening soil in trays or pots. If you're looking for a stocking stuffer for the gardener on your list these tools are a must-have[](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/potting/115936-set-of-2-potting-tools)

## Soil Blockers

If the gardener on your list hasn't given it a go yet why not introduce them to the benefits of soil blocking for starting seeds? Soil blocking is space-efficient, reduces plastic, and helps grow healthy seedlings. To get started the [20-cell handheld soil blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/20-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-9528.html)* is great for smaller seeds. For potting up the smaller blocks or for starting larger seeds the [4-cell handheld blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/4-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-7862.html) (or better yet pick up both!)

*\*At the time of writing, the 20-cell handheld soil blocker at Johnny's seeds is less expensive but backordered. Lee Valley has a [similar blocker](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/propagation/seed-starting/69004-soil-cube-mold) that is slightly more expensive but seems to be in stock.*[](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/4-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-7862.html)

## The Living Soil Handbook

Jesse Frost is a small-scale farmer and runs the No-Till gardening channel and Grower's Daily on YouTube. Even if you're not gardening on the scale of a market gardener, his book [The Living Soil Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Soil-Handbook-Ecological-Gardening/dp/1645020266) is still a must-read for any gardener interested in building healthy garden soil.

## Microgreens Grow Kit

If your recipient lives in a colder climate and is expecting a white Christmas this year, why not give them the gift of growing nutritious, delicious indoors? Growing microgreens can be a bit of a learning curve but these [Back to the Roots microgreens kits](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Roots-50041-Microgreens-Gardening/dp/B085PWHM5J) make it easy to get started. The kit includes a mix of different organic seeds, compostable starting trays and growing medium, as well as access to "Green Thumb Technical Support" for detailed microgreen growing instructions!

## Muck Boots

Being a gardener sometimes means getting out in the garden even on days with less-than-perfect conditions and [Muck boots](https://www.amazon.com/stores/TheOriginalMuckBootCompany/page/C467EE9D-7F8B-4C34-83D9-3A164D3F5D13?lp_asin=B07QL3DKQD&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto) are the perfect all-weather boots for doing just that. They're flexible and breathable so they can be worn even when it's warm out, but they're tough and waterproof to handle the muck (or a wayward spray from the garden hose!) As a thoughtful design detail, the boot soles are self-cleaning so you won't be walking around the garden on mud-clump-moon-boots.[](https://www.amazon.com/stores/TheOriginalMuckBootCompany/page/C467EE9D-7F8B-4C34-83D9-3A164D3F5D13?lp_asin=B07QL3DKQD&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto)
