When gardeners see bugs in the garden sometimes alarm bells go off but it's important to also learn about the 'good guys'- beneficial insects that help keep garden pest populations in check. In [Good Bugs For Your Garden](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/good-bugs-for-your-garden_allison-mia-starcher/417446/#idiq=1961291&edition=3280149) Allison Mia Starcher teachers gardeners all about these garden superheros and how to attract them to your garden.

Jesse Frost is a small-scale farmer and runs the No-Till gardening channel and Grower's Daily on YouTube. Even if you're not gardening on the scale of a market gardener, his book [The Living Soil Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Soil-Handbook-Ecological-Gardening/dp/1645020266) is still a must-read for any gardener interested in building healthy garden soil.

# Seed Starting and Indoor Growing

## Chestnut Potting Tools

![Chestnut set of 2 potting tools on a wooden background](https://www.leevalley.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.contentstack.io%2Fv3%2Fassets%2Fblt050573defaf102e3%2Fblt0bf2d2c24676b2a5%2F669c269f3af6f7ca8e8301e8%2Fhttps_assets.leevalley.com_Size5_10126_DB140-d-0027.jpg%3Fbranch%3Dproduction&w=1080&q=75 "Image source: Lee Valley")

These [little potting tools](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/potting/115936-set-of-2-potting-tools) might not look like much, but they are the absolute handy-dandiest tools for seed starting and potting up plants! The pointed tool is perfect for dibbling seeding holes, picking up seeds (with a bit of moisture) and for pricking out tiny seedlings. The flat-ended tool is perfect for arranging and flattening soil in trays or pots. If you're looking for a stocking stuffer for the gardener on your list these tools are a must-have.

## Soil Blockers

![20-cell handheld soil blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/dw/image/v2/BJGJ_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dwd81f175d/images/products/tools/09528_01_20blockmkr.jpg?sw=800&sh=800 "Image source: Johnny's Selected Seeds")

If the gardener on your list hasn't given it a go yet why not introduce them to [the benefits of soil blocking](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/revolutionize-your-seed-starting-with-soil-blocking/) for starting seeds? Soil blocking is space-efficient, can help reduce plastic use, and encourages healthy well-rooted seedlings. To get started the [20-cell handheld soil blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/20-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-9528.html)* is great for starting smaller seeds. For potting up the smaller blocks or for starting larger seeds the [4-cell handheld blocker](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/tools-supplies/seed-starting-supplies/soil-blocking/4-cell-handheld-soil-blocker-7862.html) (or better yet pick up both!)

*\*At the time of writing, the 20-cell handheld soil blocker at Johnny's seeds is less expensive but backordered. Lee Valley has a [similar blocker](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/planting/propagation/seed-starting/69004-soil-cube-mold) that is slightly more expensive but appears to be in stock.*

If your recipient lives is expecting a white Christmas this year (or even if not) why not give them the gift of growing nutritious, delicious microgreens indoors? Growing microgreens [can be a bit of a learning curve](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/grow-microgreens-at-home/) but these [Back to the Roots microgreens kits](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Roots-50041-Microgreens-Gardening/dp/B085PWHM5J) make it super-easy to get started.

If your giftee has some open space in their garden why not gift them packets of mixed native wildflower seeds?

If the gardener you're shopping has an interest in supporting garden wildlife, gifting them a [bat house](https://www.bigbatbox.com/collections/bat-houses) (yes, a bat house!) is a unique gift idea. Why a bat house for a gardener? Bats are amazing hunters of all kinds of garden pests and in some areas certain bat species can also help pollinate plants! It's the perfect gift for the gardener who has everything and wants to encourage all kinds of good critters in the garden.

## Muck Boots

![Green MUCK Women's Muckster II Mid Boot](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UzPjoSzZL._AC_SY575_.jpg "Image source: Amazon")

Being a gardener sometimes means getting out in the garden even on days with less-than-perfect conditions and [Muck boots](https://www.amazon.com/stores/TheOriginalMuckBootCompany/page/C467EE9D-7F8B-4C34-83D9-3A164D3F5D13?lp_asin=B07QL3DKQD&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto) are the perfect all-weather boots for doing just that. They're flexible and breathable so they can be worn even when it's warm-ish out, but they're tough and waterproof to handle the muck (or a wayward spray from the garden hose!) As a thoughtful design detail, the boot outsoles are self-cleaning so you won't be stuck walking around the garden on mud-clump-moon-boots.

## Waterproof Pruning/Wash Gloves

These might not be the cutest gardening gloves around but these [waterproof pruning and wash gloves](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/garden/clothing/gloves/62005-protective-pruning-gloves) are rugged, tough, and get the job done! They're 100% waterproof so they're great for washing down carrots, lettuce, and your other garden harvests. Not only that they're prefect for working with pokey and irritating plants like zucchini and parsnips, so you can save yourself from battle wounds on your hands, wrists, and arms.

## Rolling Work Seat
