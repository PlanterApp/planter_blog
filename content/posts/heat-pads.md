Heating Mats for Starting Seeds

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm dreaming of warmer spring weather and getting back out in the garden! To satisfy that ‚Äúgardening itch‚Äù that comes every winter, I like to dig out my seed starting supplies and grow tomatoes, peppers, and a few other veggies. Our last post focused on grow lights, which are arguably the most important piece of equipment for starting seeds. However, some seeds may not even germinate to see that light if you don‚Äôt keep them at the right temperature. So today, we‚Äôre going all-in on heat mats. üî•

### Temperature requirements

Some veggies will have no problem germinating in a cold basement (where I start my seeds), while others need some warmth to sprout in a timely fashion.

Luckily, master gardeners have determined the optimal temperature for germinating most veggies. The following chart is pulled from this [paper by the University of California](https://sacmg.ucanr.edu/files/164220.pdf):

**SOIL TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS FOR VEGETABLE SEED GERMINATION**

Many internal and environmental conditions influence seed germination: condition of the seed, presence of water, sufficient air, soil conditions, and temperature. The chart below lists the optimum soil temperatures at which they do best. This does not mean your seeds will not germinate at higher or lower temperatures, but greater success will be achieved if optimum conditions are provided. Using a probe-type thermometer is an accurate method for testing soil temperatures prior to planting seeds and small plants.
