We just took over a farm, and the previous owner planted about 150 tomato plants. You might think that’s a crazy amount, and yes, it absolutely is. But here’s the thing: we also run a micro-bakery and head to the market every week to sell our bread. And what goes perfectly with fresh bread? Tomatoes! 

Unfortunately, this summer’s weather has been all over the place, and a lot of our tomatoes have split. And because our customers deserve only the best, we’re now… well… drowning in tomatoes. so, we’ve got a delicious problem: What on earth do we do with all these tomatoes? 

If you find yourself in a similar boat, first things first: let’s celebrate the chaos. Tomatoes taste like pure sunshine: sweet, tangy, and sóóooo juicy. But when they start piling up faster than you can slice them for a sandwich, it’s time to think beyond basic salads and standard red sauce. 

So here’s the plan: let’s dive into six creative ways to turn that tomato avalanche into pure edible joy: dishes and preserves that will carry the taste of summer all the way through the cold months ahead.

### **1. Wine-Gummy Tomatoes – Jamie Oliver** 

Not sure the name really does it justice, “Wine-Gummy Tomatoes” had me expecting… well, something completely different, haha. But what you actually get are a bit like sun-dried tomatoes, only juicier.  According to Jamie Oliver himself, the tomatoes go *“wonderfully soft, sweet and sticky, and can be used in all sorts of other dishes.”* Sold. 

**Here’s the gist:** 

* Preheat the oven to 100ºC/210ºF/. Halve your tomatoes and lay them cut-side up in baking trays. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. 
* Slice some garlic and scatter a few slices over each tray. Drizzle generously with olive oil. 
* Roast low and slow, about 4 hours, until they’re soft and sticky. Cool them down. I could imagine a dehydrator might also work-out if you have one. Perhaps look into it, or ask an AI-friend.  
* Chop some fresh herbs and layer them into sterilized jars with the tomatoes. Top up with extra virgin olive oil so everything’s covered. 
* Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (if they last that long).  

They’re amazing on bruschetta, tossed into pasta or snuck straight from the jar with a fork. 

You can find Jamie’s full ingredient list and step-by-step on his website right **[here](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables/wine-gummy-tomatoes/)!**[](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables/wine-gummy-tomatoes/)

### **2. Pickled tomatoes** 

If you’ve never tried lacto-fermenting tomatoes, you’re in for a treat. It’s the same process that turns cabbage into sauerkraut or cucumbers into pickles. If you’d like to know more about lacto-fermentation, **[check out our blog post on it! ](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/lacto-fermentation/)**

The method is simple: pack tomatoes in a salt brine, let the friendly bacteria get to work, and watch as they transform into an awesome snack that keeps for weeks in the fridge. 

**Ingredients (1-liter jar)** 

* 500–600g cherry or small plum tomatoes (firm, unblemished) 
* 2–3 cloves garlic, smashed 
* 1 tsp whole black peppercorns 
* 1–2 sprigs dill or thyme (optional) 
* 1 bay leaf (optional) 
* 20g sea salt (2% by weight of the water) 
* 1 liter non-chlorinated water 

**Method** 

1. Dissolve salt in water (the brine). 
2. Wash and dry tomatoes; pierce each once with a toothpick. 
3. Add garlic, peppercorns, herbs, and bay leaf to jar. Fill with tomatoes, leaving 3–4 cm headspace. 
4. Pour in brine to fully submerge tomatoes; weigh down so they stay under. 
5. Cover loosely and keep at room temp, out of sunlight, for 4–7 days.  
6. From day 4, check daily. When tangy enough, refrigerate to slow fermentation. 

**Safety!** 

* Make sure all the tomatoes are submerged in the brine (the water + salt) 
* The brine should stay clear to slightly cloudy, if you see mold (white, green, blue, black, or pink) discard and start fresh.

### **3. The Creative Mom’s salsa!**  

If there’s one jar you’ll be glad to have stashed away when winter hits, it’s this salsa. It somehow tastes garden-fresh months after canning, the perfect match for tortilla chips, breakfast burritos or even a thick slice of a crusty bread from you fav market stand.  

You can find the full ingredient list and step-by-step instructions over at The Creative Mom*,* check out her recipe **[right here](https://www.thecreativemom.com/canned-salsa-recipe-that-tastes-like-fresh-salsa/)** [](https://www.thecreativemom.com/canned-salsa-recipe-that-tastes-like-fresh-salsa/)and get ready to stock your pantry with summer in a jar. 

### **4. Serious Tomato Jam**  

I’m slipping in a dad joke here: this tomato jam is gonna be your new jam (sorry!). If ketchup and chutney had a love child, it would be this: sweet, tangy, and a little spicy if you like it that way. It’s the condiment you didn’t know you needed until you start slathering it on… well, just about everything. 

This recipe from Serious Eats is seriously good. Check out the full ingredient list and step-by-step guide [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/tomato-jam-recipe)[](https://www.seriouseats.com/tomato-jam-recipe)!

### **5. Tomato Ice Cream** 

Okay, I haven’t tried this one yet, so I’m not entirely sure what to expect, but Louise has! And she swears it’s perfect for a hot summer lunch. According to her, it even eliminates the need for mayonnaise, so you could say I’m intrigued. If you give it a go, let us know. We’d love to hear your opinion! I can imagine it being the perfect avant-garde twist when friends or family come over and you want to impress them with something a little bougie. Louise has the full recipe written up over [here](https://www.louisecooks.com/recipe-pages/tomato-ice-cream), so definitely check out her website. [](https://www.louisecooks.com/recipe-pages/tomato-ice-cream)

### **6. Tomato Shrub** 

I didn’t really know what a shrub was, so I had to do a quick Google. Turns out, the term likely comes from the Arabic word sharāb, meaning “to drink.” In recipe terms, a shrub is a type of drinking vinegar: a tangy-sweet syrup made by combining: 

* Equal parts sugar and vinegar 
* Fruit or vegetables (like tomatoes!) 
* Optional spices or herbs for extra complexity 

While traditional shrubs often star berries or citrus, the tomato shrub is a modern, savory twist. It pairs the umami richness of ripe tomatoes with the bright acidity of vinegar, resulting in a drink that’s: 

* Perfect in cocktails (think Bloody Mary with a twist) 
* Refreshing as a mocktail with sparkling water 
* A bold base for culinary experiments 

The version featured on *Nourish & Gather* uses fresh tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar and cleverly turns the leftover solids into tomato jam (another recipe from this list!).

That’s the list for now, but there’s so much more out there. Many of these recipes are perfect as a base for your own kitchen experiments, so try, tweak, and make them your own. Before you know it, tomato season will be over and you’ll be wishing you had *The Creative Mom’s Salsa* tucked away in your cupboard for cozy movie nights, or a jar of pickled tomatoes ready to top your morning toast. 

Explore, play, and let your tastebuds be surprised! 

Happy tomato season,
