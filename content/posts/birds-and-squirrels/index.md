The idea of having birds of squirrels in the garden divides gardeners. Some gardeners actively try to attract wildlife to the garden including birds and squirrels, while others go to great lengths to completely get rid of them. Regardless of your philosophy on garden wildlife, there's no avoiding the fact that birds and squirrels have the capacity to gobble up potential harvests at an alarming rate.

So what is the best way to prevent birds and squirrel damage in the veggie garden? Let’s look at a few different techniques and the pros and cons of each.

### Provide alternate food and water sources

Information is mixed on whether it's a good idea to provide food and water for birds and squirrels in the garden. The reasoning behind providing food and water is that birds and squirrels will be less likely to go after your garden produce if there's another source of food and water more readily available. Water is important in addition to food, as often when a bird or squirrel takes a bite out of a juicy tomato or cucumber they’re mainly looking for the moisture. 

Many sources say that providing food and water isn't a good idea as it can make your yard more attractive to birds and squirrels and worsens the problem. To help ensure that providing food and water is an effective strategy and not just an invite to an all-you-can-eat garden buffet, keep some distance between the food and water station and the rest of your veggie garden. You'll also need to be consistent- if the food is gone and the water source dries up, critters could turn to your veggies instead! If you use deterrent techniques around the garden along with providing food and water outside the protected area, birds and squirrels will be less likely to spend the effort trying to get at your precious veggies.

### Use bird and squirrel deterrents

There are many suggestions online for potential bird and squirrel deterrents, such as scarecrows, plastic owls and snakes, tin foil, or shiny CDs or pie plates hung on strings. The key takeaway with physical deterrents is that birds and squirrels are actually quite smart and will soon figure out that the deterrents pose no threat to them. Moving the objects around regularly  or changing up which deterrents you use may help somewhat, but even then they might figure out that there is no real danger. The exception to this could be the idea of laying tin foil on top of your garden soil or wrapping trees in foil to deter squirrels as the feeling and sound of walking on the foil may be uncomfortable. However this is not practical on a larger scale and may make watering and garden maintenance difficult Or some sources suggest using motion activated sprinklers which would certainly cause enough discomfort to keep the birds and squirrels at bay- just be sure to deactivate them when anyone wants to go in the garden! If you happen to have a dog and you can let them out in the garden, they are probably the best bird and squirrel deterrent around!

### Plant unappetizing plants



### Apply bird and squirrel repellents

Another technique to keep birds and squirrels away from the garden is to use repellent substances. There are many suggestions for DIY repellents at home - human hair, dog hair, apple cider vinegar, garlic spray, etc. which may be questionable as to how effective there are. Chile powder is a well recognized squirrel deterrent, but it does not affect birds (a lot of backyard bird enthusiasts will put it in their feeders for this reason). One downside with using chili powder is it might not be enough to sprinkle it around your plants, however you’ll absolutely want to avoid spraying it on plants you intend to eat soon! Aside from the DIY options there are also commercially available deterrent products such as [Bonide Repels-All](https://www.amazon.com/Bonide-REPELS-ALL-Animal-Repellent-Sprayer/dp/B07JZ4LJYR/?tag=planter-app-20&th=1). These are often made from predator urine which is also a strong squirrel deterrent that doesn’t work as well on birds. Regardless of which repellent option you choose you’ll want to re-apply it regularly, especially after rainfall.

### Install bird netting and squirrel-proof fencing



Ultimately the decision of how to manage birds and squirrels in your garden comes down to your gardening preferences and how big of a threat birds and squirrels are. If you enjoy wildlife in your garden and are OK with some potential losses, a more hands-off approach will suffice. On the other hand if you live near a wooded area with huge populations of birds and squirrels and you want to minimize losses, likely using a commercial repellent spray as well as infrastructure is the way to go. Either way, so long as the technique is humane and makes you feel happy in your garden- go with that approach!
