The idea of having birds of squirrels in the garden divides gardeners. Some gardeners actively try to attract wildlife to the garden including birds and squirrels, while others go to great lengths to completely get rid of them. Regardless of your philosophy on garden wildlife, there's no avoiding the fact that birds and squirrels have the capacity to gobble up potential harvests at an alarming rate.

So what is the best way to prevent birds and squirrel damage in the veggie garden? Let’s look at a few different techniques and the pros and cons of each.

### Provide alternate food and water sources

Information is mixed on whether it's a good idea to provide food and water for birds and squirrels in the garden. The reasoning behind providing food and water is that birds and squirrels will be less likely to go after your garden produce if there's another source of food and water more readily available. Water is important in addition to food, as often when a bird or squirrel takes a bite out of a juicy tomato or cucumber they’re mainly looking for the moisture. 

Many sources say that providing food and water isn't a good idea as it can make your yard more attractive to birds and squirrels and worsens the problem. To help ensure that providing food and water is an effective strategy and not just an invite to an all-you-can-eat garden buffet, keep some distance between the food and water station and the rest of your veggie garden. You'll also need to be consistent- if there's no food left and the water source dries up, critters could turn to your veggies instead! If you use deterrent techniques around the garden along with providing food and water outside the protected area, birds and squirrels will be less likely to spend the effort trying to get at your precious veggies.

### Use bird and squirrel deterrents

There's plenty of suggestions online for bird and squirrel deterrents, such as scarecrows, plastic owls or snakes, and shiny CDs or pie plates suspended on strings. Physical deterrents like these can help for a while, but birds and squirrels are smart and soon figure out that the deterrents pose no real threat. If you're looking to protect plants just for a short time, such as while newly-sown seeds are germinating, physical deterrents may help. Moving the objects around regularly and changing up which deterrents you can also help to put off the birds and squirrels a while longer, but even then they might catch on. One physical deterrent that can work longer-term is tin foil placed on top of garden soil (with holes for water) as the feeling of walking on foil is uncomfortable. But using foil isn't practical on a larger scale and can make watering and garden maintenance difficult. If you happen have a dog that you can safely let out in the garden (i.e., without them damaging your veggies), they are the most effective bird and squirrel deterrent around!

### Plant unappetizing plants

### Apply bird and squirrel repellents

Another way to keep birds and squirrels away from the garden is to use repellent substances that they don't like. There are many recipes for DIY repellents at home - using apple cider vinegar, crushed garlic, chilies, etc. Chili powder is a well recognized squirrel deterrent, but it doesn't affect birds. Chili powder is best applied as a spray rather than sprinkled around, but you’ll absolutely want to avoid spraying it on plants you intend to eat soon! Garlic can also be effective but likewise can leave a garlicky smell on your plants if you're not careful! There are also commercially available deterrent products such as [Bonide Repels-All](https://www.amazon.com/Bonide-REPELS-ALL-Animal-Repellent-Sprayer/dp/B07JZ4LJYR/?tag=planter-app-20&th=1) (which works on squirrels, but not birds). Be sure that the repellent product you choose will repel the critters you need it to and can be used in the garden around edible plants. Keep in mind that repellents will need to re-applied fairly regularly, especially after rain.

### Install bird netting and squirrel-proof fencing

You may want to protect plants that are especially vulnerable to attack, such as newly sown seeds, but don't plants where there is plenty to go around.

Ultimately, the decision of how best to manage birds and squirrels in your garden comes down to your gardening style and how big of a threat birds and squirrels are. If you enjoy wildlife in your garden and are OK with some potential losses, a more hands-off approach will suffice. If you're dealing with a large population of birds or squirrels and you want to keep losses to a minimum, you'll likely want to invest in bird-and-squirrel-proof infrastructure. So long as the technique is humane and makes you feel satisfied in your garden, that is the best approach!
