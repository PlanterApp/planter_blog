Last year, the rabbits won. They ate my sugar snap pea seedlings. They ate my corn seedlings. They even nibbled through the green bean stalks, leaving the rest of the previously flourishing plant to wilt and die. I had a pet rabbit as a kid, and I love them. But not in my garden!

So this year, I set out to fix the problem by ripping out the old, dilappidated garden fence and replacing it with a brand-new, (hopefully) rabbit-proof fence.
