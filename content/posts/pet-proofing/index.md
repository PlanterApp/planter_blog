Many families have both plant babies and fur babies- but sometimes, these two responsibilities can clash. Are you having trouble keeping your pets out of your garden? Between fencing, various additives, or even embracing the chaos, thereâ€™s lots of ways to handle such an issue. Read on to see some of our recommendations!

### Why is Pet-Proofing Necessary?

Pet-proofing your garden is crucial to protect the safety and health of your pets. Many common garden plants can be toxic to pets if ingested; similarly, some chemicals and pesticides used in gardening can be harmful to pets, so you'll want to keep your fur babies away from it or opt for pet-safe alternatives whenever possible. Pets could also be injured by stray tools, particularly if they're sharp; or they may eat your compost and get sick.

On the other side, pets, especially dogs and cats, can unintentionally cause damage to a garden. Even through playing, behaviors such as digging, trampling, doing their business, or snacking on the plants, could cause damage. Digging can uproot plants and disrupt the garden's appearance, while trampling can lead to bare patches in lawns and flower beds. Pets' urine contains nitrogen, which can burn plants, and their feces may introduce harmful bacteria. Chewing on plants can harm their growth. Additionally, pets can disrupt beneficial insects and their role in pollination.

By implementing some preventative measures, you can make sure to protect your pets and your hobby!
