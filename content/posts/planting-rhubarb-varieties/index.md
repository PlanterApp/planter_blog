Rhubarb is a hardy perennial. It's easy to plant, care for, and harvest. With so many varieties out there, it can be overwhelming to pick the right one, and then choose a good place to plant it. 

In the first part of this series, we'll discuss popular varieties and go over how best to plant rhubarb.

### Popular Varieties

There are dozens of rhubarb cultivars, each created for different reasons. Some grow more quickly, others are sweeter, and some are suited to more challenging environments. If you live in a temperate environment, such as the UK, you will find that most, if not all, varieties will grow with good success. 

Choosing varieties more suited to your growing needs and conditions will give you healthier plants that produce more rhubarb stalks for you each year.

**Varieties for Warm Climates**

* **MacDonald Rhubarb** — Developed in the 1920s, this variety is less tart than most and shows excellent resistance to heat, wilt, and root rot. Performs best up to Zone 8 but can continue beyond that with attentive care.
* **Canada Red Rhubarb** — A compact variety with shorter, tender stems and a naturally sweet flavor. Prefers cooler conditions up to Zone 8 but can be grown as an annual in warmer zones with partial shade and consistent watering.
* **Crimson Red (Cherry Red)** — Known for its striking deep red stalks and good heat tolerance. While not ideal for desert zones, it performs well in areas with warm summers and mild winters.

**Varieties for Temperate Climates**

* **Timperley Early** — One of the first varieties ready for harvest, often by early spring. Perfect for gardeners eager to enjoy rhubarb pies and crumbles while other crops are still waking up.
* **Sutton** — With vivid red stalks and a well-balanced tartness, Sutton is both ornamental and productive. Performs best in steady, temperate conditions without extreme heat or cold, and is a good option for smaller gardens.
* **Champagne** — A classic English variety with slender, pinkish stems and a delicate flavor. Particularly good for forcing (growing in darkness to produce early, tender stalks) and favored by traditional kitchen gardeners.

**Varieties for Cold Climates**

* **German Wine** — A hardy selection with strong, thick stalks that hold up well in late frosts. Has a deep, rosy hue and a pleasant balance of sweetness and acidity, making it a favorite for preserves and baking.
* **Valentine** — Noted for its vivid crimson color and resilience, Valentine tolerates very cold winters and returns reliably each year. Less stringy than some other varieties, making it excellent for cooking.

**All-Around Variety**

* **Victoria** — A dependable heirloom and one of the oldest named varieties, Victoria produces long, greenish-red stalks with a mild flavor. Forgiving of different soils and weather patterns, it tolerates moderate cold and, with some extra shade, can survive hot summers. It’s also less prone to bolting than most other varieties.

### How to Plant Rhubarb

Rhubarb can be planted as dormant crowns (typically sold November–March) or as potted plants later in the spring. Dormant crowns are ideal for establishing a strong root system, while potted plants give a head start on growth.

Fall is the ideal time to plan your rhubarb garden, giving you time to prepare the planting site and source quality crowns. This allows you to prepare the planting site and find the best places to get your rhubarb crowns from. Many garden centers will sell them; however, you can always ask a neighbor if they have any crowns ready to divide.

**Planting Steps:**

1. **Prepare the Soil:** Choose a location with rich, fertile soil that receives plenty of sun. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12–18 inches and amend with compost or well-rotted material such as leaf mold.
2. **Dig the Hole:** Make a hole slightly wider than the root system (about 1.5 times the crown’s width) and deep enough so the base of the buds sits just above the soil surface.
3. **Planting:** Place the crown or potted plant in the hole, spreading roots gently without bending or crowding them. For crowns, ensure the buds point upward. Backfill the hole with soil and compost mix, firming gently.
4. **Mulching:** Apply a light donut-shaped mulch ring around the crown (1 inch deep, up to 1 ft wide) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and stabilize soil temperature. The mulch should be pulled about an inch back from the crown to prevent rot.
5. **Watering:** Water deeply immediately after planting to help roots settle. For the first few weeks, maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging the soil.
6. **Spacing:** Space plants 75–90 cm (30–35 in) apart to allow room for the plants to mature. Overcrowding can reduce airflow, increasing disease risk. Varieties vary in size, so check how large your plants will get before you plant; you may have to increase the spacing.
7. **Container Planting:** If using pots, choose a container at least 2 ft wide and 2 ft deep per plant. This allows for controlled soil conditions, easier relocation to shade, and better heat management in hot climates.

In the next section, we’ll cover how to select the perfect site for rhubarb.

### Choosing a Planting Location

Rhubarb thrives in sunny locations, although it will tolerate some shade quite well. The soil should be rich and fertile and hold water well without becoming waterlogged. If your soil is clay-heavy or has poor drainage, amend it with mulch and compost to improve porosity and create consistent air pockets.

Rhubarb stems are easily damaged by late frosts, unless you choose a late-cropping variety that emerges later into the spring. Sites that get the first sun of the day are ideal, as morning sun helps burn off frost and overly heavy dew quickly. Slightly elevated spots are also preferable, since cold air can settle in low areas and increase the risk of frost damage. Planting rhubarb in small mounds can help.

Very cold or very hot environments will have slightly different planting needs, which we will cover in part 2.
