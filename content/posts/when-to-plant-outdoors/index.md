As soon as the sun starts to peak out in spring it's easy to assume *winter must be gone by now…right?* Unfortunately, the cold weather doesn’t give way to warmer days reliably. Gardeners can easily be tricked into planting too early, only to be caught off guard when the thermometer dips back down again.

While there’s no hard-and-fast rule to know when it’s safe to plant outdoors, let’s dive into some of the considerations. In this article we’ll focus on deciding when to plant warm-season plants that are more sensitive to the cold, but for more info about planting [cool-season plants](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/cold-hardy-crops/) in springtime check out [How to Plant a Spring Garden](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/spring-garden/).

The first key piece of information that you’ll need to decide when to plant outdoors is your last frost date. You’ve likely already set this up in Planter (if not check-out our how-to article on setting your frost dates). While your ‘last frost date’ sounds final, in fact it’s just an estimate. The ‘average last frost date’ means that there is a 50% chance that there will be no frost after that date…but there is also a 50% chance that there could be! So planting after your last frost date means there is a good chance that you’re in the clear, but its not guaranteed. If you are interested, you can often find information on your “80% frost date” and “90% frost date”- which essentially are the dates where you are 80%-90% sure there will be no frost. So if there is still some risk of frost after your last frost date, why not just wait and plant in July? While this is certainly the safest approach, the problem is your plants may not have enough time in the growing season if you put them in the ground too late (and if they are in pots they may become root-bound the longer they go unplanted. Deciding when to plant is a trade-off between being generally sure that there is little to no risk of frost, but still planting soon enough that your plants can get growing in a timely manner.

Once you’ve done a bit of research into your last frost date, the next step is to observe the weather patterns in your area. While frost dates can guide you, each year can be different weather-wise, and you may want to change the timing of your plantings accordingly. For example, today I was looking at the two-week forecast leading up to my last frost date and I noticed that both the daytime and nighttime temperatures are expected to stay well above freezing. So this year rather than waiting until sometime after my last frost date I may take advantage of this warm spell to start planting.

On the flip side, if I was near my last frost date and looking at the weather forecast and noticing some ominously cold weather, I may hold off even past the last frost date just to be safe. Precipitation and wind are other considerations too- there is no sense putting your precious plants in the ground only to have them drown in a deluge of rain or get taken out in a windstorm. Start making notes in Planter about the weather patterns so you can refer to them in upcoming years too- you may start to spot trends over time for your area.

While weather is important, how it affects your plants can vary significantly depending on your garden’s microclimates. Microclimates are small localized areas that will have temperatures and weather that differ from the broader region. For example, highly urbanized areas tend to be a few degrees warmer than outlying areas. Or, you may have sheltered areas in your garden where heat radiates off a wall- keeping your plants protected and several degrees warmer. Whereas other areas that are highly exposed may not be safe for planting for some time. Become familiar with the microclimates in your garden and use that knowledge to your advantage- in some areas you may be able to plant earlier, in others you may need to hold off a little longer than usual.



Even if the weather is cooperating and you have a nice sheltered spot in your garden to start planting, it still might not be a good time to start planting. If your soil temperature is too low for the plants you want to grow, there is no point rushing to plant them outside. Even though they may not die because the weather above ground is cooperating, if the soil has not had a chance to get to a decent temperature for that plant, you could stunt its growth by planting too soon. To check this use a [soil thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soil+thermometer) to test the soil temperature, and research the preferred soil temperatures for the crops you’ll be planting.



And finally, deciding when to plant can also come down to how much work you’re willing to put in. If all systems are a go, and you’re ready to get plants in the ground earlier, are you willing and able to take steps to protect them if the weather happens to take a turn for the worse? If the answer is yes, you might be able to get away with earlier plantings. If not, it would be better to err on the side of caution when timing your planting and be almost certain that there is no chance of cold weather rolling in.

Don’t rush to get your warm-season plants in the ground as soon as the thermometer starts to sneak up. While planting late can put a damper on your potential harvest, planting too early can be disastrous. Look at the weather patterns and draw from your own experience (and risk tolerance!) to decide when is the best time to plant in your gardening context. The decision of when to plant will be slightly different for every gardener!
