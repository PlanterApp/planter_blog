As soon as the sun starts to peak out in spring it's easy to assume winter must be gone by now…right? Unfortunately, the cold weather doesn’t give way to warmer days reliably. Gardeners can easily be tricked into planting too early, only to be caught off guard when the thermometer dips back down again.

While there’s no hard-and-fast rule to knowing when it’s safe to plant outdoors, let’s look at some of the considerations. The first thing to know is that annual plants are classified as either cool-season plants and warm-season plants. [Cool-season plants](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/cold-hardy-crops/) fare better in colder temperatures (to a certain degree). Warm-season plants on the other hand are more sensitive to cold- it can kill them outright or at least will significantly stunt their growth.

In this article we’ll focus on deciding when to plant warm-season plants, but for more info about planting cool-season plants in spring check out [How to Plant a Spring Garden](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/spring-garden/).
