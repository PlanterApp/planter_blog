Many of us gardeners start getting the urge to get something growing as the gardening season draws nearer. We start to wonder to ourselves ‘When should I start my seeds indoors?’...all the while knowing the answer is most likely ‘not yet’. While it’s a common gardening question, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer for when you should start seeds indoors. There are several factors to consider when deciding the seed starting dates that will work best for you.

## Frost dates and growing season length

Your frost dates are the main ‘drivers’ for when to start seeds indoors in your local area. Your last frost date in spring provides a general indicator of when it may be safe to plant frost-sensitive plants (which are commonly started indoors) outside. Your first frost date in fall provides an indication of when your frost sensitive plants may start dying back from the cold.

Your first frost date in fall might seem less important when it comes to deciding when to start seeds indoors, but it is also critical because it drives how early you’ll need to start seeds indoors so that they have time to mature and produce a good harvest before cold zaps them. Some warm-season crops simply would not have enough time to produce in a cooler climate if they were not started early indoors.

In Planter, the Growing Calendar will show you the ‘Start Indoors’ window where you can start seeds indoors for various plants. The ‘Start Indoors’ window in Planter takes into account two pieces of information - your local Frost Dates and common recommendations for how many weeks ahead of then that particular plant should be started indoors. The ‘Start Indoors’ window in Planter is a range and intended as a guideline. Depending on other considerations you can decide on your own more specific indoor seed starting dates. You might also want to customize your ‘frost dates’ based on your own experience and tracking weather patterns from year-year. For more information on frost dates and how they affect when you can plant outdoors check out When Can I Plant Outdoors?

While frost dates provide a good guide for frost-sensitive plants, what about plants that can handle colder temperatures? This becomes a bit more ambiguous as many gardeners sow cold-tolerant crops directly outdoors and as they can take a frost once they are established. If you’re planning to start frost-tolerant crops inside, start with Planter and your guide and talk to other local gardeners to see when they start that plant indoors. (Also note that some crops tend to fare better if sown directly outside- for these plants Planter will not show a “Start Inside” and “Transplant” window).

## The seed varieties you choose

While there are general ‘rules of thumb’ we can use for when to start specific plants indoors, it also depends on the plant variety. Seed packets will usually state how early that particular variety should be started indoors- and this can vary pretty widely for different varieties of the same plant. This typically has to do with how long it can take that seed to germinate and how long it takes that particular plant to reach maturity and produce a harvest. For example, ‘Tiny Tim’ tomatoes are recommended to be started X weeks ahead of your last frost date…whereas beefsteaks…

If your seed packet doesn’t have that information, you’ll want to do some research on what other gardeners usually do with that variety.

## Your indoor seed-starting set-up

A major consideration for how early to start seeds indoors comes down to how quickly the plant grows and how difficult it can become to keep that plant healthy indoors. This might sound a bit trivial, but after a few seasons of indoor seed starting it becomes apparent how easy it is to run out of indoor growing space!  Seedlings that were once tiny are all of a sudden hitting the top of the grow lights, and need to be potted up to larger pots to prevent them getting root-bound. Most grow lights typically do not produce enough light to support fully-grown plants, so unless you have a strong high-end light chances are your seedlings will start to struggle if they get too big. If your seedlings become leggy from lack of light or root bound from lack of space in their containers, most if not all of the advantage from starting them indoors will have been in vain. Plants grown from weak seedlings will not be as productive as those from healthy seedlings. Starting seeds too early is a very common mistake that new gardeners make while trying to get a jump on the season but it is often not worthwhile.

Be prepared to keep your seedlings healthy even as they grow bigger!



## How much work you want to do

This is in some ways an extension of your growing space set-up.

Every year that you start seeds indoors, you’ll gain valuable experience on what works and what doesn’t. How fast did your seedlings grow? How difficult was it to keep everything healthy indoors? Was there anything you wished you had started earlier or later? Be sure to keep track of this information using notes and Events in Planter so you can confidently answer the question ‘When is the best time for me to start seeds indoors?’
