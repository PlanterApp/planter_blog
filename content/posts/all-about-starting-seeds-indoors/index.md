It can seem like a hassle to start seeds indoors- why bother if you can plant seeds directly in the garden? For some plants, starting seeds indoors is not just a nice-to-do, it’s a must-do! In this article we’ll cover the whys, whens, and hows of starting seeds indoors.

### Why Start Seeds Indoors?

The main benefit of starting seeds indoors is extra time. Some plants take more time to reach maturity than you have in your growing season. These plants must be started indoors so they have enough time to produce a harvest before the frost comes in fall. For other plants, starting indoors is optional but it gives them a head start so you can harvest from them sooner! 

Buying seedlings from the garden center is an option if you don’t want to start seeds indoors, but the cost really adds up and you won’t find as many plant varieties to choose from.

Another benefit of starting seeds indoors is being able to control the environment and tend the plants more easily. Seeds that are direct sown outdoors are exposed to potential inclement weather and pests right away. It's easier to micro-manage sensitive seedlings indoors versus having them exposed in the garden.

### How to know which seeds to start indoors

Now that we know the reasons for starting seeds indoors, how do we know which seeds need to be started indoors?

* Plants where the number of ‘days to maturity’ are about the same or greater than the number of days in your growing season must be started indoors. 
* Plants where the days to maturity are less than the number of days in your growing season can be started indoors to get a head start on the season, with a few exceptions (see below).
* There are some plants that don’t do well if started indoors and then transplanted. Common examples are root crops such as carrots and radishes (although some gardeners do start beets indoors). Beans and peas are also not typically started indoors (although it can be done).

The [Growing Calendar](https://info.planter.garden/growing-calendar/how-to-use/) in [Planter](https://planter.garden/) helps you determine which plants should be started indoors and which should be sown outside, e.g.:

**Broccoli** should be started inside then transplanted (direct sowing outside is not recommended)

**Lettuce** can be started indoors then transplanted, or direct-sown outside

**Radishes** should be direct sown outside (starting indoors is not recommended)
