It can seem like a hassle to start seeds indoors- why bother if you can plant seeds directly in the garden? For some plants, starting seeds indoors is not just a nice-to-do, it’s a must-do! In this article we’ll cover the whys, whens, and hows of starting seeds indoors.

### Why Start Seeds Indoors?

The main benefit of starting seeds indoors is extra time. Some plants take more time to reach maturity than you have in your growing season. These plants must be started indoors so they have enough time to produce a harvest before the frost comes in fall. For other plants, starting indoors is optional but it gives them a head start so you can harvest from them sooner! 

Buying seedlings from the garden center is an option if you don’t want to start seeds indoors, but the cost really adds up and you won’t find as many plant varieties to choose from.

Another benefit of starting seeds indoors is being able to control the environment and tend the plants more easily. Seeds that are direct sown outdoors are exposed to potential inclement weather and pests right away. It's easier to micro-manage sensitive seedlings indoors versus having them exposed in the garden.

### How to know which seeds to start indoors

Now that we know the reasons why to start seeds indoors, how do we know which seeds need to be started indoors? Which can be started indoors? And which should not be started indoors?

* Plants where the days to maturity are close to or longer than the number of days in your growing season must be started indoors (or otherwise purchased as transplants). To calculate the number of days in your growing season refer to your frost dates in Planter and then Google the number of days between those two dates. Compare this with the days to maturity listed on the seed packets - Planter gives an estimate in the How to Grow information but there can be dramatic differences in days to maturity between different varieties of the same plant. If there are not enough days for the plant to mature, you’ll need to start it indoors. Onions, tomatoes and peppers are common examples of plants that can have a long growing season (depending on the variety) and may need to be started indoors.
* Plants where the days to maturity are less than the number of days in your growing season can be started indoors, with a few exceptions (noted below). Why would you want to start these plants indoors if you have enough time to grow them? Primarily to get a jump start on the season so you can start harvesting earlier than you otherwise would! Lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, and squash are examples of plants that can be started indoors, but often can also be direct-seeded outside.
* Some plants typically do not perform well if started indoors and then transplanted outside. Common examples are root crops such as carrots where the transplanting process disturbs the root that we like to eat (opinions are mixed on beets)- not to mention you’d have to transplant one plant per carrot. Beans and peas are also often-cited examples of seeds that are typically best direct-sown, although rules are meant to be broken and it can be done!

By looking at the Growing Calendar in Planter you’ll be able to get an idea of which plants should be started indoors, which can be started indoors, and which should be sown outside- again bear in mind there are some variations based on the variety you’re growing so be sure to check the seed packet and research as needed.
