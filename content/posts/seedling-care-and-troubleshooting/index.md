*This is the fourth article in our [Seed Starting](../../series/seed-starting/) series.*

If you’ve been busy starting seeds indoors, you might already be at the point where your seeds have germinated and are growing into tiny seedlings (if not, be sure to check out our *[Seed Starting](../../series/seed-starting/)* series to get started!) But the conditions that seedlings need to grow and thrive are different than what they needed at first to germinate. Knowing how to properly care for your seedlings is important to get them off to the best start possible!

### Lighting and heat for seedlings

Seeds typically need warm, moist conditions for germination and most edible plant seeds do not need any light for germination. Once the seeds germinate though, it's a whole different ball game! Seedlings need to ample light as soon as they germinate.  If you’re using heat mats you can turn them off once the majority of your seeds on the mats have germinated. Refer to [All About Grow Lights](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/grow-lights/) and [Heat Mats for Seed Starting](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/heat-mats/) for more information on how to use grow lights and heat mats for germination and seedling care. 

### How to water seedlings

How much to water your seedlings and when depends on many factors such as: how well your seed starting mix holds water, the type of containers you use, and how dry your house is. Check your seedlings often- multiple times a day- and as soon as the soil starts to appear a bit dry water them right away. While you never want the growing medium to go bone dry, you may not have to be as meticulous with misting and watering as when germinating seeds. Also, if you were using a humidity dome for germinating your seeds, be sure to remove it once they germinate. Many gardeners prefer to [bottom water](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/the-ups-and-downs-of-bottom-watering/) their seedlings, but no matter how you water them, be sure your containers have drainage and don't let your seedlings sit in water. Over time you will develop a 'feel' for the right amount of water to give your seedlings.

### How to fertilize seedlings

Seeds and newly emerged seedlings do not need any fertilizer- they have all the nutrients they need inside their 'seed leaves' (‘cotyledons’). Because of this, seed starting mix often does not have any nutrients added (although some do).  It’s usually recommended to start fertilizing seedlings once their second set of ‘true leaves’ emerge. When fertilizing young seedlings, use diluted quantities of fertilizer to avoid burning them. I like to use a liquid fish emulsion fertilizer diluted to a half or quarter of the usual strength. Fertilize about once a week as the seedlings grow, and increase the frequency if the leaves start to turn yellow.

### Thinning and potting up seedlings

Thinning seedlings is the practice of removing extra seedlings so you end up with only one seedling per growing container. Gardeners often sow more than one seed per container in case not all the seeds germinate However you’ll need to deal with any extra seedlings so they don't crowd each other out. Identify the seedling that looks the most stocky and robust, and snip off any other seedlings in the container. Cutting is recommended instead of pulling so as not to damage the roots of the seedling you want to keep. If you don’t have the heart to kill the extra seedlings and you have space for the extras, you can ***very delicately*** use a small chopstick to gently unearth and tease out each of the individual seedlings for potting up.

Potting up seedlings refers to transitioning them into larger containers with more growing medium. Potting up gives seedlings enough room to continue growing without becoming stunted in a too-small container. To know when to pot up your seedlings, regularly check the roots - as soon as you see roots starting to poke out of the bottom of the container it’s time to pot up. To pot up, select a larger growing container, fill it with potting mix, then gently remove the seedling from its existing container and put it in the larger container. Cover well with potting mix. Once you pot up your seedlings they still need adequate light, so be sure to plan your space in your seed starting station accordingly!

### Common seedling problems and remedies

**Mold and damping off:** Mold on seedlings is often just an eyesore, but it can be a sign of a deeper problem. Mold forms in moist conditions - which is somewhat unavoidable when germinating seedlings. However ‘damping off’ is a mold condition that can actually kill your seedlings - to prevent this it's important to make sure you are not overwatering your seedlings. Turning on a fan on a gentle setting to circulate air can also help keep mold at bay.

**Fungus gnats:** Fungus gnats are small, black flying insects. On adult plants they are no more than a nuisance, but the larvae can inflict catastrophic damage on your seed if the infestation is heavy enough. There are many potential remedies online for fungus gnats; I find the most effective are to sterilize your seed starting mix with boiling water as a preventative measure or to apply a hydrogen peroxide solution at a 3:1 ratio (3 parts water to 1 part hydrogen peroxide).

**Root bound seedlings:** Root bound seedlings are seedlings that have been left growing in a container that is too small for too long. The roots become constricted and the plant’s growth can be permanently stunted as a result. Be sure to pot up seedlings or transplant them outside weather permitting before they become root bound. Using soil blocks or air pruning trays can also help prevent root round seedlings.

**Leggy seedlings:** Leggy seedlings are weak seedlings that are stretched too thin. To prevent leggy seedlings, make sure they are placed close enough to a light source to receive ample light, and use a fan on a gentle setting to help strengthen the seedlings.

Taking care of seedlings is not complicated, but it does require a bit of attentiveness. The key to success is to keep a close eye on your seedlings- to make sure they are not underwatered, overwatered, and they have sufficient light and nutrients. Troubleshooting and taking action as soon as you spot a problem developing can help to save your precious seedlings so you don’t have to start all over again. You’ll be rewarded for your efforts caring for your seedlings when they turn into healthy plants you can transplant into your garden!
