For my 2025 garden, my primary focus has been on reclaiming the parts of it that have been overcome by grass.  My garden is very close to our hay field, and keeping it out of my garden beds is always a constant battle.  Admittedly, I didn’t do much weed control during the winter, and now I’m playing catch-up. This spring has been flying by already! 



I’ve planted a lot of onions. The birds pull them out and toss them about the garden beds. I also have some mice or voles that have made a home in my garden beds, so that has also been a challenge. I’ve been hoping my mouser cat or a falcon or owl would scoop it up, but no luck yet! 



My medicinal herb bed is made up of many perennials, so I don’t have to do much planting. I did add a horehound plant to it, though.  



A couple years ago, I planted just two calendula plants.  Every year since I’ve had an abundance of self-seeded calendulas pop up every spring. At first, this was delightful! I do so much with calendula when I make my salves. But last year, they started to become a “garden thug” where they got so out of control they would choke out other plants. So this year, I’m taking a proactive approach, and as much as it saddens me, I’ve been plucking out calendula seedlings all over the place. I will leave a few, of course. 



April means it’s time for me to give my lavender plants their springtime “haircut.”  This keeps their shape nice and rounded and spurs on new plant growth. 



I’ve got a lot of work ahead of me before summer arrives. I want to start a “no-dig garden bed,” where I will lay down layers of cardboard in a row and then cover them with several inches of soil. I’ve never planted anything like that, so I hope it goes well. 



Thanks for reading my springtime garden journal! I’ll post again with all the new buzz about my garden.
