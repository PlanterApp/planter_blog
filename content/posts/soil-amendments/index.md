### General Guidelines

* When using animal-based additives, apply them 9 months before harvest, or at least 2 weeks before planting! These amendments are typically used to improve soil structure and support beneficial organisms in the soil.
* Mineral-based amendments are easy to over-apply because they take time to break down, so make sure to do a soil test before you start adding them! These amendments are typically used to correct mineral deficiencies.
* Make sure your plant-based amendments aren't contaminated by herbicide, or they may cause more harm than good. These amendments typically are used to improve the soil structure.

### Blood Meal

This animal-based fertilizer is slow-release, acidic, and high in nitrogen; it doubles as a repellant to some animals like deer, moles, and rabbits because of its smell. However, it can be overapplied, and may promote leaf growth on plants you're looking for flowers on. It also may attract carnivorous animals in place of the herbivores you're repelling.

### Bone Meal

This fertilizer is used similarly to blood meal, but adds calcium and phosphorus to your garden! This fertilizer may also attract carnivores, but it promotes non-leaf growth in plants instead of foliage growth. 

### Wood Ash

### Buried Scraps

### Epsom Salt

Epsom salt isn't actually a salt, but it's a compound of magnesium and sulfur. It supplements magnesium in the soil which is important for chlorophyll production. It's also sometimes used to help with germinating seeds!

### Worm Castings

These are an *extremely* rich fertilizer for nutrients and minerals! They help to improve soil structure, regulate water usage, and support beneficial microorganisms. They're so packed with good compounds that you could use them instead of potting soil, and a plant will process as much as it needs at a time so you don't have to worry about overapplying. This is a fertilizer you can make yourself, but we'll leave that for another Growing Guide!

### Inoculants



### Borax

### Eggshells

### Manure or Guano

Depending on exactly *what* you're getting this amendment from, the results can vary wildly. If you use Bat Guano, it is a fast acting and very concentrated fertilizer with a lot of phosphor. On the other hand, livestock manure is a slower-release fertilizer mainly providing nitrogen, and can help the soil's ability to hold water.
