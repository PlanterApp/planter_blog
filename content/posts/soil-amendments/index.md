### General Guidelines

* When using animal-based additives, apply them 9 months before harvest, or at least 2 weeks before planting! These amendments are typically used to improve soil structure and support beneficial organisms in the soil.
* Mineral-based amendments are easy to over-apply because they take time to break down, so make sure to do a soil test before you start adding them! These amendments are typically used to correct mineral deficiencies.
* Make sure your plant-based amendments aren't contaminated by herbicide, or they may cause more harm than good. These amendments typically are used to improve the soil structure.

### Blood Meal

### Bone Meal

### Wood Ash

### Buried Scraps

### Epsom Salt

Epsom salt isn't actually a salt, but it's a compound of magnesium and sulfur. It supplements magnesium in the soil which is important for chlorophyll production. It's also sometimes used to help with germinating seeds!

### Worm Castings

These are a fertilizer extremely rich in nutrients and minerals. They help to improve soil structure, regulate water usage, and support beneficial microorganisms.

### Inoculants

### Borax

### Eggshells

### Manure or Guano

Depending on exactly *what* you're getting your poo from, the results can vary wildly. If you use Bat Guano, it is a fast acting and very concentrated fertilizer with a lot of phosphor. On the other hand, livestock manure is a slower-release fertilizer mainly providing nitrogen, and can help the soil's ability to hold water.
