![](images/planter_preview.gif "Planning a garden in Planter.")

This garden planner app helps you arrange your garden and learn how to grow veggies. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can arrange your veggie garden in minutes. One of our favorite features is that it highlights companion and combative plant information right there, with green (companion) or red (combative) circles. Planter uses the square foot gardening technique for easy spacing, but everything about plants, including spacing, is customizable. It has over 80 fruits and vegetables, but you can always add a custom plant if your favorite isn’t included. On top of that, it has thousands of seed varieties so you can differentiate between your jalapeño and bell peppers.
