## Mexican-Style Eggs - Contributed by Erin

Breakfast need not be neglected when it comes to using your garden abundance! We had tons of extra jalapeños and tomatoes this season, and while we love making all kinds of salsas one of our favorite ways to use them is in 'Mexican-style' eggs. We eat these several times a week for breakfast and we never tire of them. Not only are they delicious, it's also rewarding to start the first meal of the day with veggies I grew myself!

This is hardly a recipe as much as an idea and cooking method, but I hope it provides inspiration for your own morning routine! The amounts listed are what we generally use for two people but you can easily adjust the quantities to suit the number of people you're cooking for and your preferences.

\- 3-4 large eggs

\- 2-3 small jalapeños, minced (adjust based on the size of your jalapenos and how much spice you like- you can also remove the ribs and seeds to make them less spicy or substitute green pepper)

\- A small wedge of white onion, diced (roughly 3-4 tablespoons)

\- 3-4 roma tomatoes, diced (you can use other types of tomatoes but roma tomatoes are ideal since they are more meaty and less watery- if you use larger tomatoes you may want to reduce the quantity)

\- Vegetable oil (or any neutral-tasting fat of your choice for cooking)

\- Salt to taste

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs together with a pinch of salt until thoroughly mixed. Pre-heat a frying pan over medium heat and add the oil. Once the oil is hot (but not smoking), add the diced onion and minced jalapeno. Cook for a minute or two until the onions turn translucent then add the tomatoes\*\** and another pinch of salt. Let the tomatoes cook down for a minute or two then add the well-mixed eggs. 

Continue cooking, stirring all the ingredients in the pan to combine them and prevent sticking. At first the mixture will be liquid-y but after about 5 or so minutes of cooking the eggs should be set and most of the excess liquid will have evaporated leaving tasty tomato-flavored eggs. Taste and add more salt if needed.

\*\**My husband tends to add the tomatoes before adding the eggs so the tomatoes break down and the flavor infuses the eggs. I tend to add the tomatoes near the end of cooking so that they stay intact yet still add tomato-y flavor. Try both ways to see if you prefer one over the other!

Serve with warm tortillas or toast, and if you have them refried beans!

### Creamy Scandinavian Cucumber Salad- Contributed by Samantha

For the last couple of summers, I've had a surplus of cucumbers from my garden. I am not really fond of cucumbers, so I grow them for my husband. But only he can eat so many cucumbers, and I didn't want all of the cucumbers to go to waste, so I looked for a way I would enjoy them, too. 

I have a small collection of Scandinavian cookbooks and came across some cucumber salads. The traditional way is basically a quick-pickled style blend of cucumbers that's usually eaten with fish. Then I came across some recipes that involved adding sour cream, apparently popular with the American Midwestern Scandinavians. I like anything with sour cream, so I tried it and made that salad all summer. Even now, as summer's gone, I still make it! Cream makes everything delicious in my opinion. This recipe is a blend of several versions I've seen, and you can customize it to your liking. 

\-2 Cucumbers, skin on or peeled 

\-1/4 Cup of sour cream, more or less as desired

\-1 TBSP of white vinegar, more or less as desired

\-1 Tsp of lemon juice

\-1 clove of chopped garlic

\-1 Tsp of fresh dill or 1/2 tsp of dried, more or less to taste

\-1 Tsp of salt and more to taste

\-Pepper

Slice the two peeled or unpeeled cucumbers fairly thin and place them in a bowl. Sprinkle about 1 Tsp of salt over the cucumbers and let them sit. After about 15 minutes, strain out the water from the bowl. Add the sour cream to the cucumbers, adding more or less as desired. Add the white vinegar, the lemon juice, the chopped garlic, the dill, and salt and pepper as desired. Gently stir the cucumbers to evenly coat. Let it chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
