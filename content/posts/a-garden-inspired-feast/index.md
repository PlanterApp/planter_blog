## Mexican-Style Eggs - Contributed by Erin

Breakfast need not be neglected when it comes to using your garden abundance! We had tons of extra jalapeños and tomatoes this season, and while we love making all kinds of salsas one of our favorite ways to use them is in 'Mexican-style' eggs. We eat these several times a week for breakfast and we never tire of them. Not only are they delicious, it's also rewarding to start the first meal of the day with veggies I grew myself!

This is hardly a recipe as much as an idea and cooking method, but I hope it provides inspiration for your own morning routine! The amounts listed are what we generally use for two people but you can easily adjust the quantities to suit the number of people you're cooking for and your preferences.

\- 3-4 large eggs

\- 2-3 small jalapeños, minced (adjust based on the size of your jalapenos and how much spice you like- you can also remove the ribs and seeds to make them less spicy or substitute green pepper)

\- A small wedge of white onion, diced (roughly 3-4 tablespoons)

\- 3-4 roma tomatoes, diced (you can use other types of tomatoes but roma tomatoes are ideal since they are more meaty and less watery)

\- Vegetable oil (or any neutral-tasting fat of your choice for cooking)

\- Salt to taste

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs together with a pinch of salt until thoroughly mixed. Pre-heat a frying pan over medium heat and add the oil. Once the oil is hot (but not smoking), add the diced onion and minced jalapeno. Cook for a minute or two until the onions turn translucent then add the tomatoes\*\** and another pinch of salt. Let the tomatoes cook down for a minute or two then add the well-mixed eggs. 

Continue cooking, stirring all the ingredients in the pan to combine them and prevent sticking. At first the mixture will be liquid-y but after about 5 or so minutes of cooking the eggs should be set and most of the excess liquid will have evaporated leaving tasty tomato-flavored eggs. Taste and add more salt if needed.

\*\**My husband tends to add the tomatoes before adding the eggs so the tomatoes break down and the flavor infuses the eggs. I tend to add the tomatoes near the end of cooking so that they stay intact yet still add tomato-y flavor. Try both ways to see if you prefer one over the other!

Serve with warm tortillas or toast, and if you have them refried beans!
