Planning a garden is not only about deciding which plants should go where, thinking about soil conditions, the orientation of the sun and which seeds you have kicking around from the most recent seed sale. Planning a garden should foremost be driven by selecting plants that you can and will use in the kitchen. One of the best ways to do that is to plan around the types of dishes you and your family enjoy preparing. If you and your family enjoy foods from around the globe, you might want to consider dedicating some space for a ‘curry garden’.

‘Curry’ is really a catch-all term that does not refer to any one specific dish. In most cultures the word ‘curry’ is not used- each dish will have its own unique name. That being said, dishes that would be loosely classified as ‘curry’ can take shape from some of the same base plants in the garden. From there you can branch out depending on the cuisine you are interested in and your family’s taste.

## Curry Garden Base Plan

For my curry garden design, I started with a core garden that has some of the foundational  plants that can form the backbone of a great curry (and not only curry- many of these form the base of all types of cuisines!)

* Garlic
* Ginger
* Cilantro
* Chilies
* Tomatoes
* Onions

When choosing the placement of the plants in the plan I tried to place them in a way that would make harvesting easy. Since garlic and onions can be slow growers (not green onions though!) and need to be pulled out of the soil, they’ve been placed on the outside. Onions also happen to be companions with the hot serrano chiles, which can potentially help to ward off pests. Two chile pepper plants will likely be prolific enough to provide your family with ample spice potential- but if you are real spice lovers feel free to ramp that number up. Cilantro has been planted in between the peppers and roma tomatoes, to hopefully take some advantage of any shade they can offer. While cilantro is associated with cuisines from some of the hotter parts of the world, it actually can’t take the heat all that well and has a tendency to bolt and go bitter. Because of this you might want to plan to plant a few successions of cilantro. Roma tomatoes were chosen because they are a nice meaty tomato that translates well when cooked into sauces and soups. A nice addition and a plant I’ve enjoyed growing this past year is ginger. The ginger is separated in containers because a) it has a long growing season and needs to be started indoors well in advance if you live in a cooler climate and b) the containers can be moved and positioned so the plants receive dappled sun (they like the heat but not direct, intense sunlight).

If you have a bit more space to play with you might want to consider adding more garlic in particular since it's such a versatile ingredient that stores well. And if you’ve got ample space to play with you could branch out into some more specific cuisines:

## Thai Curry Garden

Thai food is bright and vibrant and features an array of different veggies. To expand my ‘curry garden’ to be able to prepare some tasty Thai food I added the following plants:

![A bowl of green curry with basil and chiles on top surrounded by fresh curry ingredients](green-curry.jpg)

* Peas
* Eggplant
* Carrots
* Lemongrass
* Thai Basil
* Thai Mint
* Peanuts
* Lime

In the Thai garden plan, we’ve kept many of the elements of the base curry garden plan. The serrano chiles were swapped for hot Thai chiles, and we’ve added more garlic and onions. A pathway was left in the middle of the two garden beds to allow for easy access for tending the plants and harvesting. Lemongrass and mint were added as container plants- the lemongrass to allow for easy starting indoors and the mint to prevent it from overtaking the garden! Basil plays a little more nicely so its been added right into the garden bed. If possible try to find the Thai varieties of mint and basil to offer a more authentic flavor. For an exotic touch- peanuts and a (dwarf) lime was added to the plan- peanuts can grow well even in northern climates as long as you select an appropriate variety. Limes on the other hand are frost sensitive, but dwarf varieties can be grown as container plants that can be brought in over winter. If this is too much work, forgo the lime and plant something else instead- just consider the space you are working with and make sure to place the plants in ways where they are accessible for harvesting and will not shade out other plants unintentionally.

## Indian Curry Garden

Flipping over to a different cuisine entirely, the Indian curry garden plan still works off the same base garden, but includes some additional ingredients favored in Indian cooking:

* Turmeric
* Cauliflower
* Potatoes
* Okra
* Kidney beans
* Mustard seed
* Spinach

Turmeric is a rhizomatous plant that grows similarly to ginger. Since turmeric isn’t available in Planter (yet!) I’ve taken the easy way out and just created a ‘variety’ of ginger called turmeric. Like ginger, the turmeric is grown in pots so it can be started well in advance and moved around in the garden to capture the perfect balance of sun and shade.

Cauliflower and potatoes are included in the plan as core ingredients in the popular and delicious ‘aloo gobi’ dish. Okra is added as a key component of ‘bhindi masala’, and kidney beans are added to create delicious ‘rajma’. With drying beans you’ll want to have several plants to get a yield that is substantial enough to make a bean-based dish like rajma. Rounding out the list we have spinach and mustard- spinach can be used to make a mouth-watering ‘saag paneer’ and along with mustard and other greens in delicious ‘saag’ curries. If your mustard goes to seed no worries- mustard seed also features as a key spice in many Indian dishes.

We hope these curry garden plans have provided some inspiration to plan a fun, yet practical cuisine-themed garden! Having all the veggies at hand to create a whole range of dishes is important to be able to make the best use of your garden produce in the kitchen. The best part is [Planter](https://planter.garden/gardens) makes the process of playing around with all the different garden design possibilities easy and fun!
