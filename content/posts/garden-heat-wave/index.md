This year has been a strange one for gardeners (although aren’t they all, in some way or another?) While some areas like my own have been experiencing a relatively cool, wet growing season, many gardeners are dealing with heatwaves and drought. Heat waves can be one of the most frustrating things to deal with as a gardener. You can be doing everything right- ensuring your plants are off to a good start in fertile soil, keeping them pruned, trellised, and even watering regularly, but once an extreme heat wave hits gardening can become a battle for sheer survival. The good news is there are many techniques we can use to help our plants cope with a heat wave.

Heat and drought can affect your plants in several ways. Every plant has an optimal growing temperature range- if temperatures get hotter than this their growth rate will slow down and eventually stop (even if they have access to water). Some plants such as peas and peppers will drop their flowers and fruit when the temperatures get too hot as a survival mechanism- so even if the plant is hanging in there it might not be able to produce a harvest. Fruit Scald. Other plants such as lettuce and leafy greens will [bolt](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/plant-bolting-a-seedy-situation/) more quickly under stress caused by heat and drought. If plants do not have access to enough water they will not be able to photosynthesize and grow as fast as they otherwise would. Instead they will try to preserve as much water as possible- and you might see symptoms of this such as curling leaves and wilting. To top it off, the heat can bring with it a whole different set of pest and disease issues that can take advantage of stressed plants. So how can we help our plants stay productive and healthy when the weather is stacked against them?

One of the best things we can do as gardeners to help our gardens beat the heat is to make sure the garden is planned with the seasonal temperatures in mind. It's important to keep in mind that plants can be loosely categorized as cool-season plants and warm-season plants. While there’s no rule that says you can’t grow cool-season plants in the warmer parts of the season, they will need way more intervention on your part to survive and stay productive. Check the plants list in Planter to see which plants are cool-season versus warm-season. In other words, don’t beat yourself up too badly if your lettuce kicks the bucket in a heat wave- it's to be expected.

Warm-season crops generally grow better at higher temperatures, but even they have their limits. If you live in a particularly hot climate and tend to experience extreme high temperatures, you will want to research your plant and variety carefully to make sure you are growing plants that are adapted to your local conditions. Use notes and events in Planter to keep track of which varieties are performing well in the heat versus which are struggling, and reach out to experienced gardeners in your area for variety recommendations for upcoming years.

So, what can we do mid-season when the plants are already in the ground and the high temps are rolling in?

The foremost thing we can do to give our plants a helping hand is to make sure they have consistent access to water. Unfortunately watering is much harder to keep up with in the heat as the plant may be using up more water and water can be evaporating faster from the soil. You might need to water every day, or in some cases even multiple times a day to keep the ground moist (don’t go overboard though!) Container plants will be the most susceptible to drying out- you may even want to consider putting them in a kiddie pool and filling it with water if you’re not home during the day to water them before they dry out completely. While early morning is generally the best time to water, when it comes to surviving the heat you’ll . Don’t believe myths that you cannot water in the middle of the day- if your plants are in dire need of water as long as you are using ample, cool water they will be fine (be sure not to use hot water that has sat in the hose all day!) While you need to water more often during a heat wave and drought, you still want to make sure you are watering deeply to encourage your plant roots to go down deep to find water. Be sure to use notes and events to keep track of your watering if you’re prone to forget which garden areas received water when.

Another important thing to do before and during a heat wave is to make sure your gardens have been [mulched](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/mulching-a-must-for-your-garden/) to keep the soil cool and to help keep water from evaporating as much as possible. Not only will mulch help your plants stay cool, but it also helps keep weeds at bay. And while you may not feel like weeding in the heat, weeds do tend to steal precious moisture and nutrients from your plants when they need it most. So get out there in the early morning or evening when the sun is hiding and try to reign in any weeds.

Maybe one of the most important but most overlooked things we can do as gardeners is to create some shade for our plants. While most veggie plants do appreciate full sun, if the sun is causing them to overheat and suffer then creating some shade can help carry them through. While you can use shade cloth to cover entire sections of your garden, you can also DIY some shade with found materials around the house. Just be sure that anything you use allows for ample ventilation and some sun to reach your plants- otherwise they might cook or wither from a total lack of light. Move container plants into a place where they will not be in the beating sun all day long. This will also help to keep them from drying out as quickly. Take notes about the orientation of your plants in the sun- so when you are planning your garden for next year you’ll be able to consider how to take advantage of shade in your garden design.

While it's good to do what we can, it's also important to bear in mind that even the most experienced, attentive gardeners can have plants succumb to heat and drought. And some plants are simply far more challenging to keep alive in the heat. So don’t take it as a failure if some of your plants are struggling- count every plant that powers through as a win, and chalk everything up to a learning experience for future years. Helping your plants beat the heat is so challenging- especially since we don’t feel like being out in the heat as well! But they will thank you for your efforts with abundant harvests.
