**“How much should I plant?”** is just one of the many questions to ask when planning your garden. Another is **“How can I best use my garden space?”** 

Many gardeners will plan one thing to grow in a row or an entire garden bed. However, with some careful planning, you can make use of the time before those plants go in and after you take them out.

A single garden bed might grow radishes in spring, beans in summer, and spinach in fall—if you plan it right.

This is the heart of **succession planting**: using the same space for multiple crops over the course of the season. It’s not just for serious growers. Even a small garden can produce a surprising amount when the timing lines up.

### Planting in Waves

Some crops mature quickly and leave behind empty soil. Lettuce is a great example of this. Lettuce matures quickly and produces a lot from each plant. By staggering your plantings, you can have a steady harvest of lettuce throughout the growing season, instead of all at once.

Lettuce also keeps in the ground quite well, so you don't have to harvest it all right away. Let's look at a detailed example.

For my garden, I've planned one 3ft row of lettuce and have chosen three varieties, each with a slightly different taste and flavor profile. To plan exactly when to plant and when they'll be ready to harvest, I created this table.

This will vary based on your location. If you live somewhere particularly wet, your lettuce might not keep for as long in the ground, or it might take longer to mature.
