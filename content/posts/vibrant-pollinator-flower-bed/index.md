A well-planned flower bed can be a visual delight and a haven for pollinators. But crafting a beautiful bed can feel daunting—no one wants to lose plants after all that work! This article will walk you through a 4×8 ft layout that balances structure, color, and bloom succession.

This flower bed is best suited for zones 6-8 (with some wiggle room), and is based on two garden beds I grew a few years ago. Now that I’m in the Desert Southwest, this layout isn’t feasible for me anymore—but it’s perfect for many of you!

Here’s how the design works—with some tips to inspire your own garden.

### The Plant List

This plan uses six pollinator-friendly favorites, chosen for height variation, texture, and bloom time. All of these are available in the Planter App too:

* **Dahlia** – Tall, dramatic blooms in late summer to fall. Great focal points with vibrant, full color.
* **Snapdragon** – Upright early bloomers that bring vertical structure. Excellent for bees, and a good contrast to the looser growth habits of the other plants.
* **Bee Balm (Monarda)** – A favorite of bees and hummingbirds. Mid-season bloomers with bold texture and striking, unusual flower shapes.
* **Cosmos** – Airy foliage and daisy-like flowers that bloom all summer. Great for filling in gaps in the display.
* **Alyssum** – Low-growing and fragrant, ideal for softening edges. Looks lovely when allowed to spill gently over borders and into neighboring zones.
* **Nasturtium** – Edible, trailing blooms that add color and charm.

Together, these plants will support bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds (if they’re around where you live) across the season, with vibrant blooms across the bed from early Spring to late Fall.

### The Layout

The Planter App works in squares, which is excellent for most garden plans. But when it comes to flowers, **curves often work better**, helping the display feel natural and unified. This design uses three main zones:

1. **Tall show plants** – Dahlias and snapdragons primarily occupy the back of the bed, so they don’t overshadow the others.
2. **Medium-height massing plants** – Cosmos and bee balm help create a smooth transition with lots of texture and interest.
3. **Low, trailing plants** – Alyssum and nasturtiums fill the front. You could also add marigolds here for more color.

I like to mark up my designs (this one was done in MS Paint) to visualize how plants will overlap. I've aimed for **plenty of overlap at the front** to form a carpet that helps suppress weeds and hides bare stems that appear later on taller plants like cosmos and bee balm.
