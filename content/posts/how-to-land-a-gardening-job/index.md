**Be sure a gardening job is right for you:**

Before you embark on your gardening job hunt, it’s important to understand that gardening as a job can be very different from gardening in your own backyard. In your own garden you’re free to spend time on the chores you enjoy, whenever you feel like doing them. When gardening is your work, you'll be responsible for many gardening-related tasks, some of which might not be your favorites…You might have to weed gardens every day!

Gardening as a job can also involve working in the elements- rain, heat, and cold- whereas with your own garden you can just hide inside until the weather improves. Depending on the job, there may be physical requirements - carrying heavy things, standing for extended periods, kneeling, and bending. You might be assigned repetitive tasks to be done quickly- planting 300 lettuce plants feels quite different than planting only 3! Efficiency tends to be the name of the game with gardening jobs, compared to your own garden where you can spend as much time as you want fussing over your plants.

If you’re truly passionate about gardening, don’t let this deter you. Just go into it knowing that gardening for work might not feel as ‘carefree’ as gardening for a hobby. Otherwise, find another avenue to channel your gardening-related passion into a career without specifically doing gardening itself. Consider options such as working at a retail garden center, garden design, or horticultural research. The possibilities to incorporate gardening into your career are limitless!



**Decide what type of gardening gig you dig:**

Once you have an idea of how you want to incorporate gardening into a job, you’ll need to figure out exactly what type of gardening you want to be involved in. There are many different specialized areas related to gardening, such as:

* Landscaping & garden maintenance
* Arborist
* Agriculture
* Retail (garden centers/nurseries)
* Greenhouse production
* Botanical gardens
* Floriculture

To get started, think about what type of gardening you enjoy most as a hobby.  Do you prefer to spend most of your time in the veggie garden? Or tending your flowers? Or re-arranging your houseplants? If there’s more than one specialization that appeals to you, try to connect with people in the industry who can give you a better sense of what the work entails so you can decide which to try (more on this in the next section!)

**Research and reach out:**

Start by researching what companies and organizations in your area operate in your industry of interest. You might be surprised to find that you have one that perfectly fits your interests right in your city or town. Even if they don’t have jobs posted, try to find contact information for someone who works in the department you are interested in and reach out! You never know whether they might be looking for someone!

You should also consider joining relevant clubs and professional organizations related to your area of interest- often by connecting with people there you can find out about opportunities you never knew existed!

Being new in an industry can be hard, but keep putting yourself out there and eventually you will find groups of like-minded people who can point you to some great gardening opportunities!



**Level up your gardening skills and apply:**

Once you’ve found that dream gardening job, you might wonder how to ‘break in’ if you don’t have any previous professional gardening experience. First, make sure you have the minimum qualifications for the job (including education and certifications if applicable). If you don’t have these, your first step should be enrolling in a program to obtain these qualifications (in the meantime consider looking for a related position that can help you gain experience even without the education requirements.

If you’ve found a job you are capable of but you don’t have a prior history, when pulling together your resume think of any and all gardening skills you can bring to the table. Include your own personal gardening history, if you do any volunteer work as a gardener, and your favorite sources of knowledge in the field. Then be sure to highlight any transferable skills you might have from other work. For example, if the job requires you to do physical work outside, note that you have experience camping and hiking arduous trails. Or if speed is important, highlight a previous job experience where you had to complete manual tasks quickly and accurately. Make sure the hiring manager knows how passionate you are about the field and how much you already know- even if it's through informal learning and experience.

If you’re a passionate home gardener, incorporating gardening into your work can be rewarding and fulfilling. Make sure you have realistic expectations of what the work will entail and the qualifications required. Build your network of contacts who are already working in the field- they will help guide you and connect you with potential opportunities. Above all, don’t be afraid to go for it! You might just find your dream job.
