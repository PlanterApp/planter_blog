As back-to-school approaches it can feel like planting the garden was all but a distant memory. But with the cooler temps comes a whole new potential garden season. While some plants like broccoli and cabbage commonly need to be started in the summer to be ready in time for a fall harvest, there are still plenty of plants you can start growing in early fall! Of course what you can plant in early fall depends on your location, so as a first stop be sure to check the [Calendar](https://planter.garden/calendar) in Planter to see which plants can be grown now in your local area. This article covers a few favorite, cold-hardy crops that can be planted in early fall.

### Spinach

Considering spinach is often harvested for its tender baby leaves, it’s amazing just how cold-hardy it is. Depending on the conditions, spinach can still be going strong with minimal frost protection and snow on the ground! With added protection, some cold-climate gardeners are even able to overwinter spinach for harvests right through winter and into the following spring. Spinach is also a super fast-growing crop that can be ready to harvest in as little as 35 days- so even if you don’t feel like using season extension techniques you can still get a solid fall crop of spinach. And as the weather cools down there is less risk of your spinach bolting, meaning you can get a prolonged harvest if you only pick the outermost leaves. 

### Kale

Kale is truly an incredible plant. Not only is it astoundingly cold-hardy, once established it can grow through almost anything you can throw at it. Kale is a top low-maintenance plant pick because you plant it once and enjoy continuous harvests all season long (assuming you are harvesting it for larger, individual leaves). To harvest kale just snap off the lowest, largest leaves as close as possible to the stem, making sure to leave the top of the plant and several upper leaves intact. When harvested this way, kale can keep on producing well into fall and even winter…You might even find it grows back again the following year!

### Radishes

Radishes are an excellent crop to sow midsummer (or almost anytime, really) as they grow  extremely quickly. Radishes can reach maturity in as little as 25 days, and their compact size means that they can be tucked into almost any garden space that frees up as spring and summer crops kick the bucket. And if your radishes happen to [bolt](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/plant-bolting-a-seedy-situation/) before you get a chance to harvest them you can always let them continue growing- the green seed pods are edible (and delicious!) Then plant a whole new wave of radishes!

### Lettuce

While lettuce does not at all enjoy the heat of summer, it's good to plan for multiple plantings of lettuce throughout the growing season (this is called [succession sowing](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/succession-planting-for-nonstop-harvests/)). Lettuce is generally a quick-growing crop, especially if you are growing it as [cut-and-come-again](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/harvesting-how-to-and-when/#how-to-harvest-lettuce) lettuce rather than full lettuce heads. Lettuce planted in the summer may need a little TLC to produce a harvest. [Shade cloth](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shade+cloth) can help block out too much searing heat from the sun, and consistent watering can help to avoid stress to the plant that could accelerate [bolting](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/plant-bolting-a-seedy-situation/). And once cooler temperatures hit, your lettuce crop will be even more prolific!

### Arugula

Also known as rocket or rucola, arugula is a delicate leafy green that packs a peppery punch. If you don’t mind salad with a kick you can use arugula as the sole green, but it also makes a great addition to mesclun mix where its spiciness is balanced out with lettuce and milder greens. Or, skip the salad and sprinkle it on top of homemade pizza or sandwiches for a gourmet touch! Arugula can tend to [bolt](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/plant-bolting-a-seedy-situation/) easily so be sure to keep it well-watered to avoid drought stress, and consider sowing in regular successions to be able to continue harvesting throughout the season.

### Bok Choy

### Hakurei turnips

Thinking about turnip might conjure up memories of mushy puree served exclusively over the holidays. But you might not know that there are some types of turnips that are deliciously sweet, crispy, and can be eaten raw or cooked. ‘Hakurei turnips’ are a farmer’s market favorite that are super easy to grow. They look like a jumbo-size white radish, and grow similarly to radishes, but the taste is fresh and juicy without any of the signature radish kick (radish haters love them!) The greens are also excellent for stir-frying. Even if adding turnips to your garden has never crossed your mind, be sure to give hakurei a try!
