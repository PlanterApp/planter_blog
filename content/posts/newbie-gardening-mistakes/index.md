Gardening is a journey. It takes years to build up enough knowledge and experience to get consistently good harvests. In the beginning of the journey, you don't know what you don't know and you might make mistakes with your garden and not even realize it. Even with some gardening experience under our belts, it's easy to still make 'newbie' mistakes when we forget (or ignore) gardening fundamentals. 

So what are some common gardening pitfalls, and how can we avoid them?

## Not planning your garden

Not planning your garden is a very common mistake for new gardeners. It's easy to assume that gardening season starts with a fun trip to the garden center to load up on plants and seeds, then coming home and trying to figure out where to squeeze them in and how to grow them. While this laid-back approach can work, it can also be the cause almost all of the other mistakes listed here- like starting plants too early or too late, or not having the right plants in the right areas of your garden (just to name a couple).

Many gardeners enjoy the process of garden planning, but it does take some time to think through everything in detail. That's why the [Planter app](https://planter.garden/) is such a game-changer- you can easily plan your garden from virtually anywhere. Whether you're on a bus, on a comfy couch, or even out in your garden! Planter also makes it easy to make changes to your garden plans and visualize your garden. With a solid plan your garden will be set up for a successful growing season!



## Selecting plants and varieties that don't suit your climate

There's a lot to learn when it comes to selecting plants and varieties that are well-adapted for your climate. 

As a starting point, before buying annual plants you'll want to know your [frost dates](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/know-where-you-grow-hardiness-zones-and-frost-dates/#frost-dates-why-do-they-matter) (if applicable) and the number of days in your growing season. Luckily Planter makes this easy- you can [enter your location to get your frost dates](https://info.planter.garden/getting-started/frost-dates/) and the [number of days in your growing season](https://info.planter.garden/getting-started/growing-season/) will display automatically! Many annual plants need to be started indoors so they have enough time to grow and reach maturity well before your first frost. If you live in a region with a short growing season, you may want to seek out short-season varieties that mature more quickly so you can get the maximum harvest possible in the time you have. You should also check the variety description for information about whether a variety performs best in hotter areas or in areas with more moderate temperatures. 

For perennials it's important to know your [hardiness zone](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/know-where-you-grow-hardiness-zones-and-frost-dates/#what-are-plant-hardiness-zones) to be able to determine whether a plant will survive winters in your area. To be on the safe side you might want to choose plants that are rated a zone or two hardier than your zone, in case of a freak cold snap that could kill them off. If you want to grow perennials that are not hardy in your zone you'll need to take extra steps- or even overwinter them indoors- to help them survive.

On top considering the length of your growing season and the average temperatures, you might also want to look for varieties that are resistant to the pests and diseases that are most common in your area.

While you're gaining experience with different varieties in your own garden, talk with other local gardeners to get an idea of which plants and varieties perform best for them.

## Starting plants too early or too late

Timing is key when it comes to gardening, but it can be tricky to figure out [when is the best time to start seeds indoors](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/when-to-start-seeds-indoors/) and [when to plant outdoors](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/when-to-plant-outdoors/). At the linked articles explain, there's no black-and-white formula for when to start planting- it depends on where you are, what you're growing, and some other factors.

New gardeners often don't realize how critical it is to get the timing right in the garden, especially in a short growing season. It's easy to assume that anything available for sale at the garden center still has time to grow. You might pick up a packet of seeds mid-season not realizing they needed to be started weeks or even months ago. Gardeners with some experience know that many plants need to be started indoors (or purchased as transplants and planted early enough in the season), but with that knowledge it's also tempting to start too early. Starting seeds indoors too early can lead to overgrown plants that are difficult to keep healthy until they can be safely planted outside. And almost every gardener is guilty at some point of planting too early outdoors only to have their seeds rot or to have a late frost kill off their plants!

To hone in on the right time to start plants, out the [Growing Calendar](https://info.planter.garden/growing-calendar/how-to-use/) in Planter for a guideline on when to start plants in your area, then refer to the seed packets or plant tags for the specific varieties you are growing to get a more exact idea of when they should be planted.

## Not matching plant needs with the growing area

Another common mistake is not understanding the different needs of different plants and matching them with a spot in your garden where they will thrive. When 

## Improperly spacing plants

Proper plant spacing is crucial to having a successful garden, but new gardeners may not be aware of their plants' spacing needs (or may choose to ignore them).

## Not observing your plants regularly

Growing a garden isn't just about planting, fertilizing, watering, and waiting for a harvest. One of the most important steps to having a successful garden is to regularly observe each of your plants to make sure they are staying healthy. Many gardening problems can be corrected if they're caught early enough, but if you don't take time to observe your plants regularly issues like lack of water, lack of fertility, or pests and diseases can go unnoticed for so long that they're beyond fixing. With tender seedlings, young plants, and container plants sometimes even a matter of a few hours without water or with too much sun can be life-or-death. 

Observing plants regularly is much easier said than done with our busy daily lives. 
Sometimes having tools like irrigation systems on timers can help, but automation isn't a full replacement for a gardener's presence. The best thing to do is to figure out a gardening routine that works with your schedule, and don't take unnecessary risks with sensitive plants if you might not have time to monitor them. 

## Stressing too much about garden fails

While this is a list of gardening mistakes to avoid, keep in mind that making mistakes is a big part of gardening. Good gardeners learn from their mistakes and improve, and instead of dwell on them they look for possible solutions. If some your seedlings died, maybe there's still an opportunity to buy some transplants. If pests wiped out some of your crops, maybe there's still time to swap in a different crop. Even if you can't recover from a mistake in the same season, next season is always a blank slate to build on what you learned. 

While we all try to avoid making mistakes in the garden as much as possible, the most important thing is to not get too deflated when mistakes do happen!
