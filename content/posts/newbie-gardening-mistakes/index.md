Gardening is a journey. It takes years to build up enough knowledge and experience to get consistently good harvests. In the beginning of the journey, you don't know what you don't know and you might be making mistakes with your garden and not even realize it. Even once we have some gardening experience under our belts, it's still easy to make 'newbie' mistakes when we forget (or choose to ignore) gardening fundamentals. 

So what are some of these common gardening pitfalls, and how can we avoid them?

## Not planning your garden

Not planning your garden is a very common mistake for new gardeners. New gardeners often think that gardening season starts with a fun trip to the garden center to load up on plants and seeds, and then coming home and trying to figure out where to squeeze them in and how to grow them. While this laid-back approach can work, it can also be the root cause almost all of the other mistakes listed here- like starting plants too early or too late, or not having the right plants in the right areas of your garden (just to name a couple).

Many gardeners enjoy the process of garden planning, but it does require some time to think through everything in detail. That is why the [Planter app](https://planter.garden/) is such a game-changer- you can easily plan your garden from virtually anywhere. Whether you're on a bus, on a comfy couch, or even out in your garden! Planter also makes it easy to make changes to your plans and visualize your updated garden layout. With a solid plan your garden will be set up for success going into the growing season!

## Selecting seeds and plants that don't suit your climate

nuance to learn when it comes to selecting plants that are well-adapted for your climate. 

As a starting point, for annual plants you need to know your frost dates and the number of days in your growing season, and for perennials you need to know your hardiness zone. From there you'll also want to read the seed packets and plant tags carefully- while they might survive, some plants produce better in hot climates with long seasons while others prefer things a bit milder. Then there are plants that are adapted to being resistant to pests and diseases that may be common in your area.

While it can take some experience to find the varieties that perform best in your region, a good starting point is to research and talk to other local gardeners to get a sense of which varieties have the best chance of success.

## Starting plants too early or too late

Timing is key when it comes to gardening

## Not matching plant needs with the growing area

## Improperly spacing plants

## Not regularly observing your plants

## Stressing too much about garden fails
