Gardening is a journey. It can take years to build up enough knowledge and experience to be a 'successful' gardener, and in the beginning you don't know what you don't know. Even those that have been gardening for years can make newbie mistakes when they forget (or choose to ignore) gardening fundamentals. There are so many common pitfalls that can befall gardeners, but in this article we're highlighting some of the most common or most impactful oversights that can negatively impact your garden's success and productivity:

## Not planning your garden

## Selecting seeds and plants that don't suit your climate

## Starting too early or too late

## Not matching plant needs with the growing area

## Improperly spacing plants

## Not regularly observing your plants

## Stressing too much about garden fails
