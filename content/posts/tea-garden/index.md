So begins our series of various garden plans to inspire you! 

Today, we're focusing on an assortment plants that we can use for tea. Whether it's the fruit, leaves, root, flower, or even the seeds themselves, there's incredible range in the kind of plants that can be used for a wonderful cup of tea! We'll be focusing on some of the more common plants in this Growing Guide.

#### Harvesting

* Some plants may taste better dried or fresh, so experiment! Fresh leaves will tend to make more mild flavored teas.
* The best time to harvest tea herbs is a dry morning; too late and the heat of the sun will dry out the leaves a bit, but also drive out some of their flavor.

#### Drying

* Just as there are many options for tea plants, there are also many methods of drying your plants! Most herbs will dry out plenty when hung in paper bags (with holes poked in) in a cool, dry place. 
* However, something as simple as a microwave or a low-heat oven could also do the trick- just make sure to keep an eye on them so they don't burn!

#### Storing

* The most important thing is to keep your harvest stored in an airtight container; whether that's in bags or containers, in the cabinet or the freezer in cubes, it doesn't matter too much! It may be useful to label your containers while you're at it, if you've dried similar-looking herbs.
* To see if dried herbs are still good for tea, rub them between your fingers and smell them. If they smell like nothing, or dusty, then the best thing you can do is toss them!

#### Steeping

* About 1-2 teaspoons of your harvest with 8 ounces of water should be enough for the perfect tea. 
* Most things will be ready after about 8 minutes of steeping. If your blend is too bitter after that time, try reducing the time; or if it's too weak, increase it.
* Some teas, such as green tea, go bitter when steeped in boiling water. If your tea is too bitter, and reducing steeping time only made it weaker, try steeping with hot (but not boiling) water!
* Some of your plants aren't going to fit in a tea bag, but you can use a sieve, french press, or a tea ball to separate out the solids from the tea.

As the air gains a chill, we tend to seek both warmth and a way to use our leftover harvest. Thankfully, you can do both by making some of these herbal teas! We hope this Growing Guide brings you some comfort and heat this season- keep an eye out for more pieces in this Plan Your Garden series!



A note: You may be wondering, where's *Camellia sinensis* (the tea plant)? We looked into it, of course, but growing and making black tea at home turns out to be a very long process. Given its pervasive availability in stores, we opted to simply reference it, rather than include it as an entry. It'll join our plant roster on Planter sometime; however, if you plan to grow it before then, you can easily create a custom plant on our app!
