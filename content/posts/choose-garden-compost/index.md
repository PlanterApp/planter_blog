Most gardeners know that it's a good idea to add compost to your garden. Compost helps improve soil structure, provides food for beneficial critters in the soil, and is a good slow-release source of nutrients that plants need. The tricky part about 'compost' is it's a catch-all term for many types of decomposed organic materials. Compost usually conjures up the image of a homemade compost pile with kitchen scraps and yard clippings, but there are also bagged composts, animal manure-based composts, municipal compost, and some speciality types of compost. It's enough to make your head spin! So as a gardener how do you know which type of compost is best for your garden? The first step is to know what you want to achieve when adding compost.[](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/compost-add-life-to-your-garden/)

## Ways to use compost in the garden

There are a few key reasons to add compost to your garden:

Compost adds organic matter (humus) that improves the soil structure. Sandy soils tend to drain water too quickly and leach nutrients and clay can become water-logged. Compost helps the soil hold onto the optimal amount of moisture for plants. It provides food for beneficial organisms, such as earthworms, that work to improve the health of your soil and it also contains beneficial bacteria and fungi that help your plants to uptake water and nutrients.

It contains key nutrients that plants need to grow. Fully broken-down compost does not have high concentrations of nutrients, but the nutrients it does contain are released gradually so your plants can uptake them over time. Compost can also be a good source of trace nutrients that your plants need.

Compost also makes a great mulch which can help your garden soil retain moisture and, when applied thick enough, can help to suppress weeds.

Depending on which of these benefits you are aiming for, you'll want to choose your compost accordingly. For example if you're using compost as a nutrient source, you'll likely want to look for composted animal manures that will have higher nutrient concentrations. On the flip side if you're looking to apply compost as a mulch, because you're going to put on a large quantity (4" layer or more) you'll likely be leaning towards a municipal or homemade compost which contains high levels of organic matter but is not as nutritionally 'strong' as an animal manure.
