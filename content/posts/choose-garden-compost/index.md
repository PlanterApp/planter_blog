Most gardeners know that it's a good idea to add compost to the garden. Compost helps improve soil structure, feeds beneficial critters in the soil, and provides a slow-release source of nutrients that plants need. The tricky part about 'compost' is it's a catch-all term for many types of decomposed organic materials. Compost usually calls to mind the image of a homemade compost pile with kitchen scraps and yard clippings, but there's also animal manure compost, municipal compost, worm compost, and more. It's enough to make your head spin! How do you know which type of compost is best for your garden? The first step is to know what you want to achieve when adding compost.[](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/compost-add-life-to-your-garden/)

## Ways to use compost in the garden

There are a few key reasons to add compost to your garden:

Compost adds organic matter (humus) that improves the structure of both sandy soils and clay soils. It also provides food for beneficial organisms, such as earthworms, that work to improve the health of your soil.

Compost also can contain key nutrients that plants need to grow. The amount of nutrients contained in the compost depends on the materials used to make it- many types of compost contain relatively low nutrient concentrations.

Compost also makes a great mulch which can help your soil retain moisture and, when applied in a layer several inches thick, can help to suppress weeds.

Depending on which of these benefits you're aiming for, you'll want to choose a compost (or combination of composts) accordingly. For example if you're using compost as a nutrient source, you'll likely want to look for composted animal manures that have higher nutrient concentrations. On the flip side if you're planning to apply compost as a mulch, you'll might choose a municipal or homemade compost which contains high levels of organic matter but is lighter on nutrients.

## Types of Compost

Keeping in mind the various ways we can use compost in the garden, let's delve into some commonly available types of compost and their uses:

### Manure-based composts (including bagged manure)

Manure-based composts often consist of decomposed cow, horse, or sheep dung along with the bedding material (and possibly other inputs). While there are slight differences in nutrient concentrations and organic matter, manure from these animals is generally interchangeable so long as they are well decomposed. Manure-based composts provide both a good source of organic matter that can help improve soil structure, as well as nutrients to gradually feed your plants. They are often worked directly into the soil as an amendment.

There are also composted poultry (chicken, turkey) manures available which provide a highly concentrated dose of nutrients and are used as a fertilizer moreso than a soil amendment.

Manure-based composts can be sold in bulk (see 'commercial compost' below) or in bags at your local garden center. Composted poultry manure is sometimes sold as pellets.

### Mushroom compost

Mushroom compost is a type of commercial compost that consists of growing material from mushroom farms. It is typically a combination of aged manure, straw, and gypsum. Mushroom compost is good source of both organic matter and some nutrients. You can find mushroom compost sold as a bagged product or available in bulk from a mushroom farm. If you have access to mushroom compost it is a good soil amendment or mulch.

### Vermicompost

Vermicompost, or worm castings, is not technically a compost but a byproduct of the worms' digestive process as they digest organic materials. Vermicompost typically comes in smaller quantities as a bagged product and can be pricey compared to other types of compost (unless you make your own). It may not be sensible to use as a soil amendment in large quantities, but can useful in smaller areas, containers, and added to seed starting mix for a boost of organic matter and a light dose of nutrients.

### Leaf mold

Leaf mold sounds like a kind of fungus or disease, but it's just decomposed dry leaves that gardeners collect in fall and compost down. Leaf mold is not especially nutrient rich but it is high in organic matter, as such it can be useful as a soil amendment or can be used as a mulching compost on top of your garden beds. Since dry leaves are abundant and readily available it's inexpensive to produce leaf mold in large quantities.

### Municipal and commercial bulk compost

Municipal compost is generally produced by collecting kitchen scraps and/or yard waste from the local community and decomposing it at a high temperature to destroy weed seeds and pathogens.  Commercial bulk compost on the other hand can come from a number of sources, often with manure as one of the components, and the decomposition process can vary depending on the supplier. Municipal compost is generally relatively low in nutrients and can be used to improve soil structure or as a mulch. Nutrient levels in commercial compost will vary depending on the source materials- be sure to ask questions about the inputs, the nutrient analysis, and composting process before applying it to your garden.

### Home compost

Composting at home is an easy an inexpensive way to have a compost source for your garden. Home compost is typically lower in nutrients than manure-based composts, however it's a great source of organic matter to incorporate into your soil. Homemade compost can also be used as a deep mulch however depending on how much input material you're able to collect it may be challenging to produce in large enough quantities.

## Things to watch out for when buying compost

Unfortunately, sometimes adding compost to your garden can do more harm than good. Here are some things to watch out for when purchasing compost:

### Unfinished compost

Unfinished compost poses a risk to your garden because if the composting process has not fully completed it can 'lock up' nutrients that your plants need and cause deficiencies. Also as the compost generates heat while it breaks down this heat can harm your plants. If you're making your own compost at home be sure that the compost is ready before using it - it should be dark brown, smell 'earthy', and should not have large un-composted pieces of material. Bagged compost and municipal compost is typically fully broken down so you don't need to worry. For commercial bulk compost, be sure to ask questions about their process so you can satisfy yourself that you are getting compost that is ready to be used. 

### Weed seeds and disease

Both homemade compost and manure-based composts may contain weed seeds or plant pathogens if they have not been composted correctly such that the compost 'heats up' and kills them. For your homemade compost if you're not confident that you're able to manage your pile such that it will heat up (to at least 130Â°F) you may want to avoid putting weeds with seed heads or diseased plant material in. For commercial bulk compost, inquire about the composting process to ensure you will not get compost full of weed seeds.

### Persistent herbicides

There has been a lot of talk lately of gardeners receiving composts containing aminopyralids, a persistent broadleaf herbicide. Persistent herbicides can contaminate manure-based bulk composts as they can pass through the animals' digestive systems and can also be found in the bedding materials. They are not eliminated in the composting process. Persistent herbicide-laced compost can be a disaster for your garden as without remediation it can prevent your plants from growing properly for several years. Ask questions of your supplier to satisfy yourself that their input materials do not contain aminopyralids, and to run a test by growing a plant in that compost along with a control plant in regular container mix. If the plant in the compost fails to thrive the compost may be contaminated.

### Mulchy compost

There are some commercial bulk compost producers who add shredded wood chips to their compost product. While this compost may be aged enough so the manure is decomposed, there may still be significant quantities of wood chips in the mix that have not fully broken down. This product is often intended to be used as a mulch on flower beds or in landscaping, but if it's applied to a veggie garden and subsequently incorporated into the soil it may lock up nitrogen and cause nutrient deficiencies. Again it's important to ask questions of your compost supplier, and test the compost if you have concerns.

The next time you go to add 'compost' to your garden, give some consideration to how you intend to use it and chose the right material accordingly. By doing this you'll not only avoid potential heartache of using the wrong compost, but you'll be able to maximize the benefits of compost for the health of your plants!
