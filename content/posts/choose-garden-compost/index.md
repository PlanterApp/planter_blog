Most gardeners know that it's a good idea to add compost to your garden. Compost helps improve soil structure, provides food for beneficial critters in the soil, and is a good slow-release source of nutrients that plants need. The tricky part about 'compost' is it's a catch-all term for many types of decomposed organic materials. Compost usually conjures up the image of a homemade compost pile with kitchen scraps and yard clippings, but there are also bagged composts, animal manure-based composts, municipal compost, and some speciality types of compost. It's enough to make your head spin! So as a gardener how do you know which type of compost is best for your garden? The first step is to know what you want to achieve when adding compost.[](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/compost-add-life-to-your-garden/)

## Ways to use compost in the garden

There are a few key reasons to add compost to your garden:

Compost adds organic matter (humus) that improves the soil structure. Sandy soils tend to drain water too quickly and leach nutrients and clay can become water-logged. Compost helps the soil hold onto the optimal amount of moisture for plants. It provides food for beneficial organisms, such as earthworms, that work to improve the health of your soil and it also contains beneficial bacteria and fungi that help your plants to uptake water and nutrients.

It contains key nutrients that plants need to grow. Fully broken-down compost does not have high concentrations of nutrients, but the nutrients it does contain are released gradually so your plants can uptake them over time. Compost can also be a good source of trace nutrients that your plants need.

Compost also makes a great mulch which can help your garden soil retain moisture and, when applied thick enough, can help to suppress weeds.

Depending on which of these benefits you are aiming for, you'll want to choose your compost accordingly. For example if you're using compost as a nutrient source, you'll likely want to look for composted animal manures that will have higher nutrient concentrations. On the flip side if you're looking to apply compost as a mulch, because you're going to put on a large quantity (4" layer or more) you'll likely be leaning towards a municipal or homemade compost which contains high levels of organic matter but is not as nutritionally 'strong' as an animal manure.

## Types of Compost

Now that we know the ways we can use compost to improve our garden, let's delve into some common types of compost available and their uses:

### Manure-based composts (including bagged manure)

Manure-based composts typically consist of decomposed cow, horse, or sheep dung along with their bedding material. There are also poultry manure products available, however these are typically highly concentrated so they're not adding a lot of organic material but there are a good source of nutrients. Manure-based composts may be sold in bulk (see 'commercial composts') or in bags at your local big box store or garden center. Manure-based composts provide both a good source of organic matter that can help improve soil structure, as well as a good source of slow-release nutrients for your plants- as such they are often incorporated directly into the soil. Some say that cow manure is less likely to contain weed seeds because of the cow's digestive system, however if the compost was fully heated up this is not an issue (confirm).

### **Mushroom compost**

Mushroom compost is a type of commercial compost that consists of the leftover growing material from mushroom farms. It is a combination of aged manure, straw, and gypsum. Mushroom compost, like straight manure-based compost, is good source of both organic matter and some nutrients. You may find mushroom compost sold as a bagged product or available in bulk from a mushroom farm. There is some concern about 'high salts' in mushroom compost, however this is a myth. If you have access to mushroom compost it is a good soil amendment.

### **Vermicompost**

Vermicompost, or vermicastings, is not really a compost but a byproduct of the worms' digestive process (essentially, worm poop). Vermicompost typically comes in smaller quantities as a bagged product and is relatively pricey compared to other types of compost. However it has a higher nutrient concentration and as such can be incorporated as a nutritious (yet gentle) amendment in particular for seed starting and container gardening.

### **Leaf mold**

Leaf mold sounds like a kind of fungus or disease, but its really just decomposed dry leaves that gardeners collect in fall and compost down. Leaf mold is not especially nutrient rich but it is high in organic matter, as such it can be useful as a soil amendment or can be used in bulk as a mulch-type compost on top of your garden bed. Since dry leaves are abundant and readily available its inexpensive to use in large quantities too.

### **Municipal and commercial compost**

Municipal and commercial composts are typically available in bulk and are relatively inexpensive, or in the case of municipal compost often free. Municipal compost is typically the result of local 'green bin' programs where kitchen scraps and yard waste are broken down at high temperatures that will destroy weed seeds and pathogens. In this way it is somewhat similar to homemade compost. Commercial compost on the other hand can be from a number of sources, often having manure as one of the components, and the decomposition process may be highly sophisticated or not depending on the supplier. Municipal compost is generally relatively low in nutrients but can be used to improve soil structure or makes an excellent mulch when applied thickly. Nutrient levels in commercial compost will vary depending on the source materials. In either case for peace of mind you may want to ask for the test results as large-scale producers will regularly test their compost to ensure it is free of contaminants and to asses nutrient levels, and don't be afraid to ask questions to avoid getting a harmful compost (more on this in the next section).

### **Home compost**

Composting at home is an easy an inexpensive way to have a compost source for your garden. Home compost is typically lower in nutrients than manure-based composts, however it is a great source of organic matter for your soil. Homemade compost can also be used as a deep mulch however depending on the size of your property and how much input material you're able to collect it may be challenging to produce enough compost to deeply mulch your best.

## Things to watch out for when buying compost

Unfortunately, sometimes adding compost to your garden can do more harm than good. Here are some things to watch out for when purchasing compost to ensure it won't harm your garden:

### **Unfinished compost**

Unfinished compost poses a risk to your garden because if the composting process has not fully completed it can actually 'lock up' nutrients that your plants need and as a result can cause deficiencies. Additionally if the compost generates heat while it is breaking down this heat can actually harm your plants as well. Unfinished compost is generally a higher risk for newly germinated plants and seedlings, and is also more detrimental when it is incorporated into the soil versus sprinkled on top. If you're making your own compost at home be sure to check that the compost is ready - it should be dark brown, smell 'earthy', and should not have many large un-composted 'chunks'. For commercial compost be sure to ask questions about their composting process so you can satisfy yourself that you are getting a well-aged compost product. Bagged compost and municipal compost should be fully broken down so you don't need to worry.

### **Weed seeds and disease**

Both homemade compost and manure-based composts may contain weed seeds or plant pathogens if they have not been composted correctly such that the compost 'heats up' and kills them. For your homemade compost if you're not confident that you're able to manage your pile such that it will heat up (to x degrees) you may want to avoid putting weeds with seed heads or diseased plant material in. For commercial compost be sure to inquire about their process to ensure you will not get a compost full of weed seeds.

### **Persistent herbicides**

There has been a lot of talk lately of gardeners receiving composts containing aminopyralids, a type of persistent herbicide. Persistent herbicides can contaminate manure-based composts (typically bulk composts not bagged composts from your garden center) as they can pass through the animals digestive system and do not break down in the composting process. Persistent herbicides in your compost can be a disaster for your garden as without remediation it can prevent your plants from growing for several years. The only ways to protect yourself from these types of compost is to ask questions of your supplier to satisfy yourself that their source materials do not contain persistent herbicides, and to run a test by growing a plant in that compost along with a control plant in regular container mix. If the plant in the compost fails to thrive and dies off quickly the compost may be contaminated.

### **Mulchy compost**

Mulchy compost is a variation on unfinished compost, but it is worth mentioning separately. There are some commercial compost producers who will add shredded wood chips to their compost product - often mixed with manure. While the compost may be aged enough so the manure is fully decomposed and won't burn your plants, there may still be significant quantities of wood chips in the mix that have not yet broken down. This product is often intended to be used as a mulch on flower beds or in landscaping, but if it is applied to the soil surface and subsequently incorporated into the soil it can lock up nitrogen and cause nutrient deficiencies. Again it's important to ask questions of your compost supplier, and possibly run a test if the material you receive seems to contain a lot of woody material.

The next time you go to add 'compost' to your garden, give some consideration to how you intend to use it and chose the right material accordingly (PS. you can always use more than one!) By doing this you'll not only avoid potential heartache of using the wrong compost, but you'll be able to maximize the benefits of compost for the health of your plants!
