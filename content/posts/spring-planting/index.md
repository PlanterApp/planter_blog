As the weather starts warming up in spring, the itch to get gardening starts to set in. Planting a spring garden is a great way to get a jumpstart on your growing season. But not all plants can tolerate spring weather. Don’t be fooled by mother nature- spring weather can bring a little bit of everything, from high winds, to rainstorms, to heat and even snow! Don’t be deterred by the unpredictability of spring weather though, just choose your plants wisely and take some steps to protect them from the elements!

The first thing to think about when considering planting outdoors in spring is whether the soil is workable. You might see on the back of seed packets ‘plant outdoors as soon as the soil is workable’, but what does this mean exactly? Of course, the main consideration is whether the ground is frozen or not- if you’re digging down and hitting soil that is still hard as a rock, most seeds will not survive in that. But the other thing to think about when deciding whether your soil is workable is how wet the soil is. In the spring the soil is often super-saturated with water from melting snow and springtime rain showers. Workable soil should be relatively dry- definitely not muddy or mucky- as planting seeds into cold, soaking-wet soil can increase the chance of them rotting and dying. To accelerate the soil drying out in spring, try planting into raised beds first, or cover parts of your garden with tarps to help protect it from excess precipitation.

Once you’ve determined that the soil is satisfactory for spring planting, the next step is to determine which plants can tolerate the springtime cold. To do this, look in Planter to find plants that are Tolerant and Semi-Tolerant of frost:

Frost tolerant plants can survive temperatures from X to X, and Semi-tolerant plants can survive temperatures from X to X. Check your annual average temperatures to determine which plants can survive at the time of planting- and be sure to buffer a bit to account for extremes!

Once you’ve identified plants that can take the cold, you’ll need to sort out whether to seed them directly outside or to transplant them. Some plants do best being direct seeded versus started indoors and transplanted - you can identify these by looking at the growing calendar in Planter. Then, there are some plants that can germinate well in the cold where some plants will not germinate well in the cold even though they are frost tolerant. As an example:

For plants that you transplant, keep in mind that young seedlings will still need to be hardened off before planting - even though the intense summer sun and heat has not set in they still need to build resistance to the cold, wind, and the sun. And don’t just abandon your seedlings once they are transplanted- they may need some extra protection until they get over the stress of being transplanted.

And regardless of how hardy your spring plants are, watch the weather forecast like a hawk and be prepared to use [season extension techniques](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/season-extension/) to protect them from extreme weather.
