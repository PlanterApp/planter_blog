The end of October is fast approaching and with it the end of the 2025 gardening season here in Huron County, Ontario. After a couple frost warnings and light frosts, last night we had the first hard frost of the fall. Part of me wishes we still had several more warm, sunny months to keep on growing and part of me is ready to cozy up indoors by the fire and start planning for next season!

In past gardening seasons, I’ve used season extension techniques to keep my plants alive and productive as long as possible. In my home garden I’ve managed to keep tomatoes and peppers alive and somewhat productive well into November and December, just by covering them carefully at night and on cold days. At the market garden where I used to work we had hoop houses and a heated greenhouse to keep production going as long as possible. I enjoyed delaying the inevitable and harvesting from still-healthy plants as the warm days became fewer and farther between.

This year being my first year with my own market garden, the end of the season went a bit differently. The last Farmers' Market was on October 11th; since we are a new operation and the market was our primary sales outlet this marked the end of most of our sales for the year. What was still growing in the field was mainly for us, our family, friends, and neighbours. We haven’t yet invested in low tunnels, hoop houses, or greenhouses so this year our plentiful end of season bounty is available on a limited-time basis only. At the market garden scale, unlike my past home gardens, it doesn’t really make sense to try to save plants without the proper infrastructure. Anticipating the incoming frosts, we’ve focused our efforts on harvesting, eating, processing, and storing copious amounts of tomatoes, peppers, and squash. We’ve left the cool-season crops to be harvested as-needed, and we continue to enjoy an all-you-can-eat buffet of lettuce, arugula, various Asian greens, spinach, swiss chard, parsley, carrots, turnips, and radishes.

Aside from harvesting as much as possible, I’m starting to get antsy to get the garden cleaned up and put to bed. Normally I’m somewhat “middle-of-the-road” when it comes to my fall garden cleanup philosophy. I like to leave some plant debris behind (from disease-free plants) to provide nutrients to the soil, to help prevent erosion, and to spots for beneficial insects to overwinter. Some larger plants I might cut off at the base and remove, leaving the roots behind to decompose, while smaller and more cold-hardy plants might be left until spring. However in the new garden this year I experienced more pest and disease pressure than I have in the past, so I am trying to clear away plant debris (...and weeds…) more thoroughly in hopes of freezing out some of the pests and disease spores over winter.

To that end, I started pulling up and cutting off plants- before they were even showing signs of cold damage- knowing that there was a lot of work to do and mother nature could throw me a curveball (a snowball?) sooner than expected. I have to admit this was a bit of a tough task, since the plants still looked healthy and the bees were still enjoying their flowers. I’m heartened though to have had such a productive season, and I know there will be a great sense of satisfaction to get the field cleaned up before the snow flies. Plus I still have several beds of radishes and arugula in flower that I’m leaving for the last possible moment so the bees can still enjoy them.

The process of putting the garden to bed in the fall tends to put me in a reflective mood. I’m thankful for the year, the harvests, and for all the things that went well. This year I was proud of getting started with my dream of starting a market garden- especially having just moved and with many unknowns to deal with. I was also proud of successfully growing some new crops for the first time such as salsify, and I had great success growing microgreens which I’d found in the past to be a bit of a learning curve.

Looking ahead to next year I’m already thinking about which crops to focus on, how to dial in my garden plan, and how to expand our capacity. While the focus at this time of year is mainly on the final harvest and garden wind-down, there is one fall planting task I always look forward to- planting garlic for next year. Garlic planting is especially enjoyable since it’s the one thing that can still be planted even when other crops are being cleared out, and it makes me look forward to the upcoming growing season. >>> While I’m looking forward to getting my plan together, and engaging in some indoor garden related activities like saving seeds and possibly growing more microgreens, for now I’m savoring every sunny day I get to enjoy out in the garden.
