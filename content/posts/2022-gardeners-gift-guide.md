The best socks to garden in are usually boring old black socks (they never get dirty!) But [gardening-themed socks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gardening+socks) make for a fun holiday gift that lets the recipient show off their passion for gardening even when they’re not in the garden!

Serious gardeners will love this [Roo gardening apron](https://www.amazon.com/Roo-Garden-Apron-Collection-Washable/dp/B00XV2KM20?th=1). It’s not just any old apron with pockets- it opens at the bottom allowing you to quickly offload a large harvest into a wash bin or storage container. This is a must-have for gardeners that grow lots of tomatoes, peppers, or squash.


### Garden Tool Set

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiskars-Garden-3Piece-Ergo-Scratch/dp/B01MUXL5V8?&linkCode=li3&tag=planter05-20&linkId=b982d44338636717b8f33f9c4ccafd00&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MUXL5V8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=planter05-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=planter05-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01MUXL5V8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

### Indoor Hydroponic Garden

How do you scratch that gardening itch during the winter? Move the garden indoors, of course! [AeroGarden Hydroponic Gardens](https://www.amazon.com/stores/AeroGarden/page/1C957391-DD17-4684-B4E7-94CFD437E4B2?ref_=ast_bln) are easy to use and will provide fresh herbs, lettuce, or even cherry tomatoes year-round!


### Mini Greenhouse

![Mini greenhouse with pepper plants](/uploads/Mini-greenhouse.jpg)

[Mini greenhouses](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mini+greenhouse) are great for protecting tender seedlings and plants from harsh winds, driving rain, and chilly-ish weather, or for an indoor seed-starting setup. For outdoor use, be sure to weigh the mini greenhouse down (or otherwise secure it to the ground or a fence) and use extra fastenings to hold down the shelves.


### Garden Labels

Gardeners can always make use of an extra set of [garden labels](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=garden+labels) to help keep track of seedlings and plants. Garden labels make a great stocking-stuffer!

### Gardening Hat

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/EINSKEY-Protection-Waterproof-Breathable-Packable/dp/B01J1GQ1F6?&linkCode=li3&tag=planter05-20&linkId=f638ae670fedcea80531e9633e291823&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01J1GQ1F6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=planter05-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=planter05-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01J1GQ1F6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Spending a lot of time in the garden means a lot of potential for sun exposure. This [Einskey gardening hat](https://www.amazon.com/EINSKEY-Protection-Waterproof-Breathable-Packable/dp/B01J1GQ1F6/) is inexpensive, but it stands up to the elements. After a full season of daily use, the only noticeable wear is a slight color fading. The under-the-chin drawstring may not be the most fashionable choice, but it's a lifesaver on windy days!


### Garden Trug

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBTRUGS-Medium-Tub-Gallon-Yellow/dp/B000UJWNWY?th=1&linkCode=li3&tag=planter05-20&linkId=ec0dbca754fc02e869c0460d914886fa&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B000UJWNWY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=planter05-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=planter05-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B000UJWNWY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

A [garden trug](https://www.amazon.com/TUBTRUGS-Medium-Tub-Gallon-Yellow/dp/B000UJWNWY?th=1) is a super-handy flexible basin for harvesting, washing produce, lugging around compost and soil- or just about anything really! They are available in a wide variety of sizes and colors so be sure to choose the one that’s right for your intended recipient (or yourself!)


### Soil Sieve

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tierra-Garden-GP104-Galvanized-Woven/dp/B001614ZCG?&linkCode=li3&tag=planter05-20&linkId=30e4df61883c6afd5331be70e3118a63&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B001614ZCG&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=planter05-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=planter05-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B001614ZCG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This compact [soil sieve](https://www.amazon.com/Tierra-Garden-GP104-Galvanized-Woven/dp/B001614ZCG/) is great for sifting soil and compost, and you can also use it for rinsing off your veggies! It’s not the biggest sieve on the market, but it's the perfect size for sifting potting mix for seed starting and for sifting soil in smaller garden spaces.


### Kneeling Pad

![A gardener kneeling on a kneeling pad](/uploads/Gardener-kneeling.jpg)

A comfortable [kneeling pad](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kneeling+pad) is a must-have for gardeners. Having a kneeling pad helps tackle long weeding, seeding, and transplanting sessions without getting scraped up knees. Gardeners who have trouble kneeling may prefer a [garden seat](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=garden+seat) instead.


### Grow Bags

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/VIVOSUN-5-Pack-Thickened-Nonwoven-Handles/dp/B01I1D9OOU?th=1&linkCode=li3&tag=planter05-20&linkId=a91323d9b0941925881e28d505183a51&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01I1D9OOU&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=planter05-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=planter05-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01I1D9OOU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Even if your recipient mostly gardens in-ground or in raised beds, every avid gardener can make use of [fabric grow bags](https://www.amazon.com/VIVOSUN-5-Pack-Thickened-Nonwoven-Handles/dp/B01I1D9OOU?th=1). Great for patio gardening, these bags are lightweight and easy to move around, so plants can be repositioned as needed throughout the season. Grow bags have very good drainage, so make sure your giftee knows to keep an eye on watering.


### Gardener’s Hand Care

A hand care gift basket is a thoughtful gift for gardeners. Include some [gardener’s hand soap](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gardeners+hand+soap), [gardener’s hand cream](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gardeners+hand+cream), a [nail brush](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gardeners+nail+brush) and other hand care tools to clean and soothe hard-working hands!
