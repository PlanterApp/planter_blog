Known for its warm and spicy flavor, ginger is a very popular spice and herb. It’s native to Asia, but it has been enjoyed all over the world for a very long time. It’s a tropical plant that loves heat and humidity, growing conditions that many of us don’t have, especially in the northern hemisphere. Those of us in the colder climates can still grow our own ginger at home.  

### About Ginger 

*Zingiber officinale*, or ginger, can be grown as a perennial in zones 9 and above. In the colder zones, it can be grown as an annual. It takes around 8-10 months for a plant to mature enough for a good harvest. Unless you live in an area that is warm for most of the year, starting ginger indoors in a container in January or February is the way to go. 

### Where to Find a Ginger Start

Ginger is grown from a rhizome instead of a seed. Some farms offer “seed pieces” or “mother” ginger for sale. Most ginger farms sell rhizomes that are certified organic and disease-free. You can also use ginger you find at the grocery store. It’s not too common, but store-bought ginger has a small chance of carrying fungus and disease.  Sometimes conventionally grown, store-bought ginger is treated with an inhibitor to control early sprouting. Choosing organically grown ginger minimizes the risk of problems with sprouting and disease.

Choose a rhizome that feels firm (no squishy, bruised, or moldy ones). Look for ginger with a lot of big “eyes”. This is where the leaves will sprout from.

### Starting Ginger

Soaking ginger in water before planting isn’t totally necessary, but it can take off any growth inhibitor that might be on it and it helps to rehydrate the ginger, possibly making sprouting faster. So, it’s a step worth mentioning. You can soak it overnight or even for a day or two.

If you have temperatures that are consistently above 60 degrees at night, you can start ginger outside, in an area with some dappled shade and moist and rich soil. 

### Growing Indoors

Ginger plants grow outwards rather than deep down in the soil, so if you plan on keeping your ginger in a container, choose one that is wide, with good drainage. Place your ginger rhizome on the surface of a rich potting mix, with the “eyes” facing upward. You can bury it in the soil about an inch down, or you can gently firm it on the surface, topping it off with soil but leaving the eyes exposed. Either way works. Leaving the eyes exposed might result in faster sprouting. If your container is big enough, you can put more than one rhizome in. Just make sure to leave some space for growth. Water your newly planted ginger. Use a heated seedling mat to help encourage growth. Keep it somewhere warm and bright, but out of direct sunlight. Heated greenhouses are a perfect place for ginger, but as long as it is kept warm it will do well in the house. 

It can take a few weeks to see any shoots or roots from your ginger. If you left your eyes exposed to the light , start covering them up with soil once you see some growth.

### Mimic a Tropical Habitat

Keep your ginger happy by making sure it gets watered regularly, not too much, but just enough to keep the soil moist. Being a tropical plant, ginger loves high humidity in the air. Keep your potted ginger close to other potted houseplants to naturally increase the humidity. Use a humidifier in your home if your air is extremely dry. It’s a good idea to feed ginger every month with a low-nitrogen fertilizer, being careful not to apply it directly to the plant.  

### Moving Day

You must keep ginger protected in your home or greenhouse until outside temperatures are, ideally, in the 70’s and above. For a lot of us, that means summer. Ginger does well in pots so you can simply move your pot outdoors when the time comes. Just make sure to place it in a partially shaded spot as you don't want to be baking ginger in the sun. If you move the plant directly into a garden bed, the same rules apply. 

### Harvesting

You can harvest pieces of ginger any time you want, but if you want the whole rhizome then the best time is in the fall, before the frost returns. You can harvest the whole rhizome or you can leave at least 2 inches with at least 2 eyes and return it to a container and continue growing it indoors over the winter. Store your ginger in the refrigerator. 

Ginger is so versatile in the kitchen and can be used for sweet or savory dishes. In traditional medicine, ginger is used to take the edge off of[ nausea,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25912592/) improve [digestion](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/ginger-benefits#:~:text=Ginger%20is%20not%20just%20delicious,Nausea%20relief.), promote good [circulation](https://juniperpublishers.com/ctbeb/pdf/CTBEB.MS.ID.555985.pdf), and many studies show it has [anti-cancer](https://juniperpublishers.com/ctbeb/pdf/CTBEB.MS.ID.555985.pdf) potential.  

Sure, it’s easy to go to your grocery store and pick up ginger any time you want it, but there’s something special about making gingerbread cookies in December, from fresh ginger that you started nearly a year before. If you have the extra time and a little bit of space I think it’s worth trying out at least once!
