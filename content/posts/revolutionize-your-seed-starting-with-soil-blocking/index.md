Have you been curious about the technique of soil blocking? Wondering why you might want to try soil blocks instead of the usual seedling trays? Well then, you’ve come to the right place!

Soil blocking is a seed-starting technique that can be a bit baffling for many gardeners who aren’t familiar with it. The beauty of this technique is that it’s a versatile option for gardeners who have troubles with seedling roots or simply want to cut down on their hobby’s waste. It’s not a difficult task, but it does require some preparation and a bit of a learning curve, so if you only plan to work with small numbers of seedlings, this method may not be the best for you. If you’re interested, but don’t want to invest in a soil blocker tool, there are also many DIY methods that you can use to make soil blocks right at home. If soil blocking sounds like something that might fit in with your gardening plan, read on!

### What are the benefits of soil blocking?

#### 1. Fewer Rootbound Seedlings

The primary benefit of soil blocking is that plants won’t get rootbound, like they would in a container! If a plant’s roots reach out and find a solid blockage, they’ll start turning to find space to grow out. In a small container, those roots will just keep on turning until they fill up the space: that’s called being rootbound. Rootbound plants, even when you transplant them, will take a few days to get their roots redirected to point outwards again.

Why doesn’t soil blocking do this? Well, it’s because roots react differently when they come in contact with air instead of a barrier! If a plant’s roots reach out and meet and find open air, they’ll stop growing out in that direction, putting energy into different branches of roots. This is called air-pruning, and when the roots that have met air are transplanted into the ground or a larger soil source, they will start to grow straight out again! 

#### 2. Less Transplant Shock

Hand-in-hand with the reduction of rootbound plants, is the reduction of transplant shock! When you transplant out of a seed tray, you may be familiar with the fact that roots can become damaged when you have to shake and squeeze and jostle the seedlings out of the containers. No need for any of that with a solid, standalone block of soil- just pop it in the soil, and it’ll grow readily from its little cube!

#### 3. Less Material Waste

***(NEEDS FINISHING)** Many seedling trays are pretty fragile, and break down quickly. Plus, there’s so many sizes of plastic seedling trays- with soil blocking, you can make just about any container into a seedling tray! Seed trays also may result in more rootbound seedlings, if they are allowed too much time in the container, but we’ve covered that particular topic plenty up above. If you've dealt with large-scale plant production, you're probably familiar with just how much waste could be involved with*

### What tools will I need?

When it comes to deciding on the size of soil blocks to use for germinating seeds, there are a few factors to consider. Small seeds or those that require warmth to germinate would do best in smaller blocks, such as ½ inch cubes. Using smaller blocks helps with heat absorption, especially if a heat mat is being used. For most other seeds, 2 inch blocks should work just fine. 

If you're unsure, ½  inch blocks are a safe bet as long as you aren’t using seeds that are particularly large. Most ½ inch blocks will also transplant easily into larger cubes if needed!

If you're feeling crafty, you can even make your own soil block maker at home using items like tin cans, PVC piping, or even pill bottles. [You can click here for an example of such a project!](<https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2014/04/diy-soil-block-maker.html>)
