If you want to stay within your gardening budget this year, consider propagating some of your plants this season!  To propagate means to create new plants from a single parent plant.  You can do this with quite a few plants, but basil is one of the easiest.  If you like basil, you know it’s an herb you can do a lot with because it can go with savory and sweet dishes.  For me, summertime means making a lot of fresh pesto. If you take basil cuttings every couple of weeks, you can have unlimited supplies to take you through fall and even into winter. 



Supplies needed:



One healthy basil plant (preferably one that has not flowered yet)



Scissors or trimmers



A jar or propagating vessel



Water



Choose a basil that looks well-grown and healthy.  



Trim below a leaf node.



Strip the lower leaves off of the stem. You can strip more leaves to keep them out of the water, but Make sure to leave at least two leaves attached to the stem. 



Place your cuttings into clean water.  Basil doesn’t need to be dipped into rooting hormone to develop roots, especially if you do this in the spring and summer months when there is a lot of natural light.  



Place your cuttings on a sunny windowsill. 



Change the water every couple of days.



Roots should start showing up in about 2-3 weeks. 



After you have roots around 1-2 inches long, they can be potted up or moved directly into the garden. 



If you pot them, use a good soil mixture; basil likes moist soil.



In summer, you can plant the cuttings directly into the ground. 

Once your transplanted cuttings get established, you can take cuttings from those plants and keep the process going as long as you want. Once frost returns, it’s time to move the basil back inside, of course. 

It really is that easy to keep the basil-goodness going all summer and beyond.  It's like getting plants for (almost) free!
