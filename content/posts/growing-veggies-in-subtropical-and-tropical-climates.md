Are you starting a veggie garden in a subtropical and tropical climate? These regions offer a unique set of conditions for growing veggies, and it's important to understand the differences between the two and choose the right plants for your area.

### Subtropical vs Tropical ðŸŒ´

First, let's define the key differences between subtropical and tropical climates. Subtropical regions have mild winters, and the temperature typically doesn't go below freezing. On the other hand, tropical regions have warm temperatures year-round and usually high humidity. The main difference between these two climates is the temperature; subtropical climates have a cooler winter period, while tropical climates are consistently warm. While many subtropical climates are humid and wet, they can also be dry and arid, such as the southwest United States.

### What to Grow

When it comes to gardening in subtropical and tropical climates, it's all about choosing plants that are well-suited to the weather. Some popular choices include:

* [Beans](https://planter.garden/plants/beans)
* [Cucumbers](https://planter.garden/plants/cucumbers)
* Cowpea (aka Black Eyed Peas)
* [Eggplant](https://planter.garden/plants/eggplant)
* [Okra](https://planter.garden/plants/okra)
* [Peppers](https://planter.garden/plants/peppers)
* [Pumpkin](https://planter.garden/plants/pumpkin)
* [Squash](https://planter.garden/plants/squash)
* [Sweet corn](https://planter.garden/plants/corn)
* [Sweet potato](https://planter.garden/plants/sweet-potatoes) - these grow really well during the wet season ðŸŒ§
* [Tomatoes](https://planter.garden/plants/tomatoes) - choose heat-tolerant varieties or cherry tomatoes, which are hardier than bigger varieties
* [Watermelon](https://planter.garden/plants/watermelon)

These veggies thrive in warm weather and can give you a constant supply of fresh produce. 

Leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach, and kale can also be grown, but they'll require a bit more care as they are more susceptible to bolting and disease in the heat. Instead of these, consider growing mustard greens, Asian greens, or [bok choy](https://planter.garden/plants/bok-choy).

For tropical climates, many of the same veggies can be grown, but it is essential to choose varieties that are more tolerant to high heat and humidity. It's also important to pay attention to the soil quality, make sure it's well-draining, and amend it with organic matter if necessary.

When in doubt, it's best to check with a local resource to determine what works best for your specific climate. [Planter](https://planter.garden) is a terrific app, but cannot account for the intricacies of every micro-climate. Your dirt-covered and sunburned garden-obsessed neighbor will know exactly what works in your area ðŸ˜‰.

### What NOT to Grow

Now, let's talk about the veggies you should avoid. Cool-weather crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage will have a tough time in tropical climates. You can see whether a plant is a warm or cool weather crop in Planter's [quick info section](https://info.planter.garden/plant-information/how-to-grow/#quick-infoo).

Root veggies like carrots, beets, and radishes might also struggle because the soil can get too warm to successfully germinate the seeds.

### Pests and Diseases

Another thing to keep in mind is pest and disease control. In sub-tropical and tropical climates, pests and diseases can be an even bigger hassle. To control pests, you can use natural methods such as [companion planting](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/companion-planting-diversity-is-key/) and using [beneficial insects](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/16-of-your-garden-s-local-pest-hunters/). Diseases can be controlled through proper watering, good air circulation, and avoiding overcrowding.

### Conclusion

Gardening in subtropical and tropical climates presents some unique challenges, but with the right plants and care, you can enjoy a delicious and bountiful harvest! By understanding your climate, choosing vegetables that are well-suited to your specific region, and controlling pests and diseases, you can have a thriving vegetable garden all year round. Happy gardening!
