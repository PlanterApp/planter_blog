![Park Seed easy tunnel product image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/518n6lsGDxL._AC_.jpg "Image source: Amazon")

The [Park Seed tunnel](https://www.amazon.com/Park-Seed-Standard-Tunnel-Protective/dp/B08X7H4M41/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3SK9K8I6N2IHK&keywords=giant%2Beasy%2Bpoly%2Btunnel&qid=1701707280&sprefix=giant%2Beasy%2Bpoly%2Btunnel%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-5&th=1) is an easy and inexpensive way to get started with season extension techniques! They offer convenient telescoping low tunnels covered with either poly plastic, fleece row cover, or netting depending on the desired degree of protection. The best part is how easy it is to move the tunnels around the garden to where they’re needed.

### Hamilton Beach Dehydrator

While it's a kitchen gadget, the [Hamilton Beach dehydrator](https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-32100A-Digital-Dehydrator/dp/B012CG8N26/ref=sr_1_11?crid=10OPIZTPMPYHP&keywords=dehydrator&qid=1701707368&sprefix=dehydrator%2Caps%2C101&sr=8-11) is the perfect gift for an avid gardener who finds themselves with gluts of produce that need preserving! Having a dehydrator means that fresh garden fruits, veggies, and herbs can be enjoyed year round- as dehydrated produce can store for up to several months- and helps prevent any precious produce from going to the compost pile!

### Spider Farmer Seedling Heat Mat Kit

A seedling heat mat might seem a bit frivolous- after all isn’t the house heated in winter?- but for some seeds such as peppers, having that added heat in the soil is key for good germination rates. Be sure to choose a heat mat that comes with a thermostat such as this [Spider Farmer seedling heat mat kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DPKXRRD/ref=emc_b_5_t?th=1) that allows the temperature to be precisely controlled to avoid over or under-heating the soil.

### True Leaf Seed Kits

For those with a large-sized in-ground garden who are direct seeding long rows of vegetables, a row seeder like the [Earthway precision garden seeder](https://www.amazon.com/Earthway-1001-B-Precision-Garden-Seeder/dp/B00002N66A/) is a gamechanger!
