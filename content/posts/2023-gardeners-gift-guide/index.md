A seedling heat mat might seem like an unnecessary extra piece of equipment, but for some seeds such as peppers having the added heat in the soil is crucial for good germination rates. Be sure to choose a heat mat set that comes with a thermostat and probe such as this [Spider Farmer seedling heat mat kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DPKXRRD/ref=emc_b_5_t?th=1) avoid over- or under-heating the soil.
