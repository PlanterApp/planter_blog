If you've been following the [Planter](https://planter.garden/) "Herbs" series, you may have seen the post about harvesting herbs. After you harvest you must start the process of saving your herbs.  Drying your herbs is the best way to preserve your harvest for long-term storage. There are several ways to do this at home. 

### Paper Bag Method

The paper bag method is nice because it doesn't require anything fancy.  Place your herbs in a clean paper bag, ensuring not to fill it too much because good air circulation is critical for successful drying. Leave the bag somewhere with good airflow, that is above 65 degrees. This method doesn't work very well if you put the bags in a cool and damp place. If you can hang the bag up on a hook, that helps with proper airflow; if not, you can use a fan in the area.  If you live somewhere very humid, you might want to add a dehumidifier to the room. Some good herbs to try this method are chamomile, rose petals, sage, thyme, yarrow, etc.  If you are trying this with roots, you must have the roots cut up into small chunks, and it really helps if you can hang near a fireplace. For roots, I strongly recommend investing in a dehydrator.  Each paper bag should only have one kind of plant, and it's a good idea to write the plant's name on the outside of the bag.

### Hang Drying

You can dry bunches of herbs with long stems by tying their stems with twine or using rubber bands and hanging them upside down on a hook or a hanging drying rack. Clothes drying racks can be put to use for drying herbs. Keep them somewhere well-ventilated, out of direct sunlight, and away from steam, condensation, or moisture sources in the air. This is the preferred way to dry lavender, especially if you want to keep dried bunches for decor.  You can cut the flower head off and place it upside down in a paper bag to collect the dropping seeds.

### Drying Racks

Herbs can be laid on top of mesh drying racks, allowing air to circulate all around. Keep racks out of direct light and in a well-ventilated area. Stir the herbs around every few days. You can find racks in stores, online, or even make your own out of an old window screen. 

### Dehydrator

If you plan on drying a lot of herbs or want a fast way to dry herbs, then you might want to use a dehydrator. Using a dehydrator is the most reliable way to dry roots.  Dehydrators come in many styles and budgets. When using a dehydrator, you don't want the temperature to go above 100 degrees F, as this can compromise the quality of the herbs.  A suitable average temperature for herb drying is 85-90.  While herbs are drying, it can be helpful to stir them occasionally.  Drying times can vary depending on how much you are processing. A dehydrator assures you that those tougher-to-dry herbs, like calendula, with their resin-rich centers, won't mold during storage. It's worth mentioning dehydrators can give off a lot of heat. 

### Ready for Storage

Herbs can be stored when they crumble easily, or their stems snap. If they are bendy or soft at all, they are not ready. If there is even just a little moisture left, herbs can mold. If you dry your herbs on stems, you can remove them from the stem. Stems don't hold much goodness in a plant. Cut roots in half to ensure they are thoroughly dried.  Dried herbs are freshest if you keep them in their whole form. They tend to lose potency faster if you crush or powder them. The best containers to store herbs in are air-tight glass ones.  You can use plain old Mason jars.  Try to keep your jars in a dark area and out of light. Light can degrade the quality of herbs. Always label your jars with the plants' names, and you can add the date that you jarred them up. If you keep your herbs in a cool and dark place, dried flowers and leaves can stay potent for a year or more. Roots can stay vibrant even longer.  If your herb has lost its smell and looks less than vital, it's time to compost them.

Some herbs can be frozen for use in the kitchen. Sage, lemon balm, rosemary, and bay leaves can be frozen in plastic bags or ice cube trays.  

### Problems

If herbs aren't thoroughly dried before they are stored, mold can grow. If you find mold on any of your stored herbs, it's best to compost that batch.  It can be disheartening to throw away a whole jar of herbs, but mold spores are present, and it's not worth risking your health. 

Drying herbs from your own garden is so rewarding and easy!  Give it a try this season! Check the Planter app for more information on harvesting herbs.
