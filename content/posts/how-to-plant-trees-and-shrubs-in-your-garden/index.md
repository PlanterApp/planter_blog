Planting a tree or a shrub can be a long-term commitment, but it can be a great way to expand your gardening horizons. Once planted and mature, though, your new plant (or plants) will offer up harvests for years to come and bring environmental benefits as well. 

### Location, Location

Where you plant your tree is very important, because it will dictate both what you can plant there as well as how well it will do there. Your climate is the primary concern, however you may want to consider certain trees over others depending on variables such as size. A large tree will need room away from things like buildings so that it can put out a good root system. Similarly, different shrubs and trees will have different light needs. Your soil may led itself to certain plants better than others, depending on its nutrients or pH. All of these are important factors to consider when you're looking to introduce a major new addition to your garden!

### The Plant for You

Make sure to research the type of plant you’re hoping to grow. Fruiting plants may need to be planted in pairs, if they are not self-fertilizing, but some varieties don’t need a partner in order to produce fruit. Depending on the area you have for it as well, you may prefer a dwarf variety, or if you're hoping to plant some sun-sensitive plants in a few years you might be looking for a large tree to provide shade.

### It's All About Time

Tree in hand, it's important to choose the right time to plant. The best time to plant is during dormant seasons- after leaves fall in autumn, or before buds emerge in spring, while the weather is cool.

### Now We Prepare!

It's important to prepare the planting area to avoid transplant shock, which can occur due to root damage

* Rake away ground cover like mulch and leaf litter
* Dig a hole 2-3 times wider than the root ball or container, and as deep. 
* If the tree or shrub roots have a covering of some kind, make sure to remove it! It can restrict root growth very severely if you leave that on.
* Carefully shake off excess dirt from the plant, and if there's any circling roots you can carefully straighten them out. Plants container-grown are particularly prone to becoming rootbound, so be sure to pay special attention to such plants.

### Time to Plant

* When you lower your plant into the hole, make sure to hold it by the root ball, not the stem or branches.
