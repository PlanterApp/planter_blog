We've covered a good number of considerations that you should make when planning what, when, and where to grow. 

In this article, we’ll explore ways to manage yields, store food and herbs, and offer tips for gardening in tight spaces. We’ll also discuss planting strategies, storage techniques, and ways to keep your harvest fresh longer, whether you’re in a small apartment, a large backyard, or somewhere in between.

### Eating Fresh vs Storing

It’s important to consider how you’ll use your harvest. As mentioned in the earlier parts of this series, staggering your planting dates and growing multiple varieties can help ensure a consistent supply of fresh produce throughout the season. This works especially well for tender crops like lettuce that have a short storage life and don’t freeze well.

Many herbs can be dried, and vegetables like carrots and onions can be chopped and frozen—or stored fresh—for cooking year-round. Canning is also a great way to preserve crops such as beetroot and tomatoes.

Storing produce over the winter means growing more at the right time. If you live in a cold climate, remember that food consumption typically rises during the winter months (around 10-30%), so if your goal is to be self-sufficient from your garden, this is an important consideration. 

#### Staggered Planting and Storage

Let's use carrots as an example.

In the garden bed, I have 1 3ft row of carrots planned. They're planted next to beans and onions, which are companion plants, so they can share nutrients, and keep pests and diseases to a minimum, which should give a better harvest. The carrots are eventually replaced by kale, which can overwinter and handle the cold weather better.

To plan how much to plant, I created a table:

With the Planter app, you can easily map out your garden and ensure proper spacing between plants. The app suggests planting 16 Danvers per square foot–up to 48 per 3ft row (3 ft x 1 ft)-- helping you optimize your garden space for healthy growth. 

### Small Spaces

If you’re short on space, container gardening is a powerful solution. Pots work well on balconies, patios, or anywhere with limited ground. Many herbs, alliums, and even compact vegetables thrive in containers.

With some care and attention, a lot of plants can be grown in pots, from potatoes to strawberries. Pot planting allows you to get really creative and layer plants. It's important to focus on companion plants for pots, as space and nutrients are limited. 

### Overwintering Crops

Some vegetables, like kale, overwinter well in many climates. Others, like rhubarb, are perennials—plant once, harvest for years. Overwintering crops are easy to plan into your garden.

Everything except the Zinnia will overwinter quite nicely where I live. The turnips will also replenish a lot of soil nutrients and improve the health of the garden bed for the year to come.

### Yields

You may not know exactly how much to plant the first year, so keeping notes and logs is useful. Note what varieties grow well, how long they took to grow, how long they kept in the ground, stored in the fridge, etc., to help you carefully plan next year’s harvest. Additionally, you can estimate many varieties by looking at the *per-plant yield.* We’ve linked some good resources below to help you.

### Other Considerations

**Crop Rotation**

Planting the same crop in the same spot year after year depletes soil nutrients. Rotating crops helps maintain healthy soil and reduces pest issues. Use the Planter app to track what’s planted where and plan your rotations.

**Determinate vs. Indeterminate**

Determinate plants (like some tomatoes and beans) produce all at once—great for preserving, but potentially overwhelming. Indeterminate varieties yield steadily over time, ideal for fresh eating. Knowing the type helps you plan harvest timing and storage needs.



### Recording Information


Tracking your garden’s performance helps you grow smarter each season. Key things to note:



* **What worked (and didn’t):** Which varieties thrived? Which ones struggled or weren’t worth the effort? 
* **Yields vs. expectations:** Did you get more or less than you thought? Were there any surprises? 
* **Care needs:** Which plants required the most attention, and were they worth it?
* **Over-- or under-planted:** Did you grow too much of something? Not enough? 
* **Pests, weather & timing:** Jot down issues like late frosts, drought, or recurring pest problems, plus when each crop actually matured.



### At the Harvest

There's a lot to consider when planning how much to grow. It's unlikely you'll have a perfect garden your first year, but keeping track of everything will set you up for success.
