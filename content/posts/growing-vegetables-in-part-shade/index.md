One of the things most of us first learn as gardeners is how important it is to select a full-sun location for a veggie garden. Unfortunately though, many of us don’t have the luxury of having an extra large backyard with full-day sun exposure. Or, even if you do have a nice sun-drenched garden, sometimes there are underutilized areas of your yard that you look at and wish you could grow some food there. If this hits home for you, read on to what you can grow in part-shade.

### Do all veggie plants need full sun?

The short answer is, for the most part all vegetable plants will grow best in full sun. Full sun means 8 or more hours of sun per day. **Explain why.** But don’t despair! There are some plants that will grow well in part shade (6-8 hours of sun per day).

Also, depending on how you set your expectations and how much sun exposure the garden actually gets, you may have some success growing plants that typically prefer full sun in a shadier location.

If your garden location is in near total shade and gets only a few hours of sun each day, you may want to skip down the **Alternatives to gardening in part-shade section** of this article. While you can certainly have fun experimenting with growing edible plants in shade (you might even discover some non-traditional edible plants that grow well in shade), you’ll likely only be able to muster up a meager harvest.

### Veggie plants to grow in part-shade

**Lettuce and leafy greens**

Lettuce and other leafy greens such as spinach, chard, and arugula are star performers in the shade. In some ways they even prefer shade as blasting summer sun can contribute to them [bolting](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/plant-bolting-a-seedy-situation/). To get them off to a good start you may want to consider starting them indoors then transplanting out to the shadier parts of your garden. Be aware that it may be challenging to get lettuce to form full heads in part-shade, but you can certainly harvest it as [cut-and-come-again](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/harvesting-how-to-and-when/#how-to-harvest-lettuce) lettuce.

**Green onions and chives**

‘Bulbing onions’ require full sun to form bulbs, however green onions and chives are excellent shady garden plants because they are primarily harvested for their slender, pungent greens.

**Radishes**

By now you might be noticing a theme with the shady-garden plant picks: they tend to be green and leafy. Radishes add a nice burst of color to an otherwise monotone shady salad garden. While radishes grow at their quickest in full-sun, they will still form nice bulbs when grown in part shade. Be sure not to use too much high-nitrogen fertilizer when growing radishes though, as this will encourage them to form lush leafy tops and skinny bulbs (although if this does happen all is not lost as radish greens are edible too!)

**Beets**

Like radishes, beets are another bulbing root crop that can be grown in partial shade. The roots of shade-grown beets will most likely be noticeably smaller than their full-sun counterparts, but you can always roast them whole as ultra-gourmet baby beets! Just don’t leave them in the ground too long hoping for massive roots as you might just find they turn woody and tough instead. Beet greens are totally delicious in salads or cooked, so if you do find the bulbs discouragingly small the greens will not disappoint!

**Brassicas (such as broccoli, cabbage, collards, kale)**

So long as your part-shade garden receives 3-6 hours of direct sunlight per day you can grow brassicas there. Because brassicas, like leafy greens, are prone to bolting under the stress of extreme heat and drought conditions, growing them in shade may help to avoid this. However patience is key as brassicas are already slower-growing crops, and they will grow even more slowly in the shade. You likely will not be able to get large-sized heads to form on your broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, but you can certainly harvest smaller, tender heads. Be sure to start brassicas indoors to give them the best possible chance to grow and reach maturity in the shade.

**Peas**

While peas perform best when they receive full-sun, you can still get a harvest if they are planted in part-shade. You could also consider trellising your climbing peas so that the plants are planted in part-shade but are able to climb up and over to a full-sun location. It is important to plant your peas with enough time for them to reach maturity before the summer heat comes - while shade will keep them a bit cooler, eventually the weather will be so hot that they will stop flowering. This is a bit easier said than done in part-shade as shady locations take longer for the soil to warm up and the plants will grow more slowly- so plan accordingly!
