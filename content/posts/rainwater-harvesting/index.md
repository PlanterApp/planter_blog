Summertime often brings ‘feast-or-famine’ rain patterns that can be frustrating for us gardeners. For weeks there’s not a drop of rain to be had, then a month’s worth of rain gushes down in a few days. Rather than just hooking up to the tap every time you need to water your veggies, you might want to consider harvesting rainwater to use in the garden. Rainwater harvesting can be beneficial for your plants, your wallet, and your local water supply- but before you install a rain barrel there are some important considerations to bear in mind.
