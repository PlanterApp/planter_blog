Hey there, gardeners! Have you been dealing with nutrient deficiencies in your garden? It's a common hurdle for gardeners to overcome, but don't worry- nutrients are something that is very manageable to resolve and maintain.

### What nutrients are important in the garden?

First things first, let's talk about the essential nutrients your plants need. There are three primary nutrients that plants require in larger quantities, often referred to as N-P-K:

1. Nitrogen (N): Vital for leafy growth and that lush green color we all love in our plants.
2. Phosphorus (P): Important for strong root, flower, and fruit development- so, key in food production.
3. Potassium (K): Helps with overall plant health, disease resistance, and fruit quality, so your hard work proves fruitful (pun intended!)

### How do I know that my plants are nutrient deficient?

Now, how do you spot nutrient deficiencies? Keep an eye on your plants for any unusual signs:

* Yellowing leaves: Could indicate a lack of nitrogen.
* Purple or red leaves: Suggests a phosphorus deficiency.
* Yellow edges or leaf curling: Could be a sign of potassium deficiency.

A soil test will also tell you when and if your plants have a nutrient imbalance, so regular testing is a good habit for any gardener to get into!
