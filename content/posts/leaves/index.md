Is the lovely local canopy shedding its spring into your yard? Putting your leaves to work means you're returning your trees' hard work and nutrients back into the ecosystem!

## Why should I bother?

Leaves are free mulch, fertilizer, or insulation all in one! They're very good at holding water, and full of nutrients. They're a rich source of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, andÂ particularly carbon- all gathered over the whole warm season. They're food and home alike to your local critters, from worms to fungi to bacteria. They can be a blanket to both insulate soil and protect it from the elements. Bundling it all up in the trash is a waste of such a readily available and all-natural material!

## Okay, so how can I use it?

### Shred Your Leaves

You don't necessarily need a leaf shredder for this- taking your lawn mower over the leaves should do just fine! Breaking them down into smaller pieces makes it easier for your garden's natural decomposers to process. This isn't required, of course, but it helps!

Mix them into your soil



### Insulate Your Plants

A thick layer of leaves will protect your plants' sensitive roots from the biting cold of frost. No amount of leaves will fake a summer's warmth; but by blanketing cold-hardy plants with leaves, you can push your growing season even past the frosts.

Attract Worms

A layer of leaves on top of your garden is like a buffet to your voracious tunneling friends. 

### Start Preparing for Next Season

Maybe you don't want to dig into your soil right now, with the temperatures dropping, and that's okay! You can start your leaves in a compost pile to have nutritious soil ready for next season, or even start a leaf mold pile. Pound for pound, leaves have twice the mineral content of manure, so they'll give a great boost to your garden no matter when you use them!

#### What is Leaf Mold?

Left to its own devices, a pile of leaves will be a lovely food source to fungus. If you push your leaves into a pile and let it run its course, in a couple of years it'll process into leaf mold, a special kind of compost that's high in calcium and magnesium, and holds enough water to rival even peat moss!
