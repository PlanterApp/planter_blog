### Ladybugs and lady beetles

Ladybugs are incredibly good at controlling small pests like aphids and soft bodied insects like caterpillars or thrips! They won’t harm your plants as larvae, as they eat pests throughout their life cycle rather than plant matter. *Lady beetles and lookalikes

### Parasitic wasps

Braconid wasps eat aphids, beetles, caterpillars, hornworms, and stink bugs; they are also parasites that attach their larvae to caterpillars. Don’t worry- though they are called wasps, they don’t sting!

### Lacewings

Lacewing larvae eat tons of pests: aphids, mites, thrips, mealybug, whitefly, leafhoppers, and some beetle eggs and pest moth eggs. Once they grow up, however, they’ll feed on nectar and pollen; thus, they’re attracted by plants like dill, yarrow, fennel, and tansy.

### Damsel bugs

Not to be confused with damselflies, damsel bugs eat many pests that eat commercial crops, as well as aphids, mites, caterpillars, and moth eggs! They’re attracted by many herbs such as fennel, alfalfa, spearmint, dill or chamomile.

### Aphid midges

Aphid midges feed on around 60 different types of aphids, as well as other soft bodied insects! They’re attracted by most plants that produce a lot of nectar or pollen… also Dill! Noticing a trend? They’re even more effective at controlling aphids than ladybugs!

### Ground beetles

While other predators on this list often hunt on the plants, ground beetles take on the ground. They hunt in and on the soil for slugs, snails, and other night pests. They dig and are nocturnal, so they’ll be active at a different time than other predators in your garden. They make their homes in decaying plant matter, so they like well mulched gardens and stones to hide underneath.

### Hoverflies

Hoverflies eat aphids, thrips, scale insects and caterpillars; they’re almost as effective as ladybugs! Hoverflies are attracted to a large number of herbs such as yarrow, dill, feverfew, fennel, lemon balm, and parsley.

### Soldier beetles

Soldier beetles prey on aphids, pest eggs/larvae, and caterpillars. They also help pollinate some flower species like zinnia, marigold, and daisies!

### Pirate bugs

Pirate bugs are very small, fast predators that eat soft bodied insects like aphids, spider mites, and thrips.

### Praying mantids

![](https://ucarecdn.com/cd6d1dc7-1ed7-4af2-83ae-c52c7a94f5cb/prayingmantid.jpeg)

Praying mantids are very efficient and eat larger pests like flies, crickets, and beetles; they can be incredibly useful but they will also hunt the beneficial insects.

### Dragonflies and damselflies

![](https://ucarecdn.com/03e12a47-2728-402a-9da9-e6277ea5f5d0/dragonfly.jpeg)

Dragonflies eat mosquitoes, gnats, midges, and practically any small flying insect as adults but like mantises, they’ll attack what they can get. This means they’ll also hunt beneficial insects like butterflies, bees, and even other dragonflies. They’re attracted mostly to plants near water, like cattails, but are also attracted to flowers like yarrow, borage, and echinacea.

### Assassin bugs

Assassin bugs tend to eat pests that eat foliage, like caterpillars, grasshoppers, aphids, and grasshoppers; however, as “assassin bug” is a very broad category, not all assassin bugs are safe. Some assassin bugs bite and they vary in the strength of their venom, so they can be harmful to humans. Some can also carry harmful parasites.

### Tachinid flies
