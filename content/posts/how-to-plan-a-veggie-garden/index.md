Are you starting your first veggie garden this year? Or are you an avid gardener that just doesn’t like to plan? No matter your experience level, it's important to start the gardening season off right with a garden plan. Creating a garden plan will save you from having to find spots to cram in all your plants after a spontaneous trip to the garden center (not that we’ve ever done that…😅)

### Measure your garden space

The first step in creating a garden plan is to understand how much space you have to work with. Usually you would measure your garden space with a [long tape measure](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Open-Reel-Fiberglass-Measure/dp/B07TGWZMVW/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2NVJCGSYWQSF7). But garden planning often starts in winter, and if you live in a cold region the idea of trouncing around in snow drifts with a tape measure might not appeal! Instead of waiting until the spring thaw, you can use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to estimate the size of your garden space:

1. Look up the address on Google Maps
2. Hover over the “Layers” tile in the lower-left corner then click ‘Satellite’

3. Use the + button in the lower right corner to zoom in
4. Right click on one corner of your garden space as a starting point for your measurement then select ‘measure distance’
5. Click on another corner of the garden to measure the distance between the two and make note of this measurement (you might need to try this a few times)
6. Click X in the pop up window at the bottom of the screen and repeat this process again to measure the other side (length or width) of your garden. 

After doing this you’ll have two measurements to work with- your garden length and width. If you have objects around the edges of your garden, you might need to take a few smaller measurements to map out the space. Since this is an estimate, you may want to shave a few feet off each side to ensure your garden plan will ultimately fit into the space.  Plug these measurements into Planter to start creating your garden plan!

If your garden space is large, for the best performance you might want to create one garden for planning your garden bed layout then create separate gardens to plan each of the beds.

*(Garden customizations and the ability to create multiple gardens are [Premium features](https://info.planter.garden/account/premium-subscription/))*

Before investing in materials and building new beds it's a good idea to still get out there with a tape measure (once the snow melts!) to confirm your estimates.

### Plan your garden bed locations

Once you know how much space you have to work with, you can start planning where your garden beds will go. 

A few things to think about when deciding where to place your garden beds:

* **Sunlight:** most veggie plants need full sun to grow properly, so it's important to understand which parts of the garden get full sun. Unless you live near the equator, the sun’s position will change in summer versus winter. If you haven’t already noted the position of the sun and any shady areas in your garden during summer, you might find [Shademap.app](https://shademap.app/) a helpful tool. Shademap lets you fast-forward to any day in summer to see the sun and shade patterns in your garden throughout the day..
* **Access and pathways:** it's important to make sure the size of the garden beds will be comfortable to reach across for working and harvesting, and to leave enough space between the beds to easily walk through the garden with tools and potentially a wheelbarrow.
* **Vertical structures:** some crops such as pole beans and peas, indeterminate tomatoes, and cucumbers (to name a few) perform best when grown up a trellis or another vertical structure. Think about where you’ll place these structures, and how they may cast undesirable or desirable shade on your other plants.
* **Drainage:** if there are areas of your garden where the soil tends to stay soggy, you might want to avoid placing garden beds there or plan on building raised beds.
* **Perennials:** with perennial plants that come back year after year such as asparagus, berry bushes, rhubarb, etc. you will need to be extra thoughtful about where you place them to make sure they have the growing conditions they need and you’ll be happy with the location once the plants reach their mature size.

### Decide which plants to grow

Now that you’ve planned your garden bed layout it's time for the best part– picking the plants you want to grow! To decide which plants to grow ask yourself a few questions:

* What veggies do you and your family like to eat? If you grow veggies that you just don’t tend to eat that often, all your efforts might end up going to waste.
* What grows well in your area? It’s fun to experiment in the garden but it’s good to know which plants that could be more challenging to grow in your area so you can take steps to ensure their success, like starting seeds indoors.
* What plants are space and cost efficient? If you have a small garden it might not be space or cost efficient to grow large pumpkin plants, but you might want to grow some premium lettuces, dwarf tomatoes, and herbs that will give you a good harvest in a small space.

If you haven’t created your garden plan for this year yet, it's time to get started! A successful garden starts with a solid garden plan, and Planter makes garden planning as fun as garden planting!
