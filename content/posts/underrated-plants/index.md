Popular plants such as tomatoes, peppers, and beans often take center stage in the summer garden. It can be easy to fall into the routine of planting the same favorite crops over and over again. But even if you stick with the classics, it’s worth branching out and trying a couple new plants each year. There are some plants that can tend to be overlooked that can make excellent additions to the garden if you give them a chance. You might just discover a new favorite plant to add to the must-grow list!

### Tomatillos

If you have ever enjoyed ‘salsa verde’ at a Mexican restaurant, you should definitely give tomatillos a try in your garden! Tomatillos are in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family like tomatoes and peppers but in many ways they are easier to grow. They do enjoy heat and a long growing season, but as long as you get them up and running in time they will produce like crazy until frost comes. They are relatively disease-and-pest resistant, and pruning or fancy trellising is not required! You can let your tomatillos bush out and offer them some support in a sturdy tomato cage- then watch them take off!

### Potatoes

Potatoes are another Solanaceae family member that might get short shrift in the garden. Why bother using precious garden space to grow something that is so cheap in the grocery store? If you can eke out a few square feet somewhere in your garden (doesn’t need to be prime real estate) it is worth giving potatoes a go. It is recommended to use seed potatoes purchased from a garden center for the best possible yields, but some success can be had by plopping a few sprouting potatoes from your pantry into the ground. Potatoes do prefer loose, fluffy soil and appreciate sufficient moisture and nutrients, but otherwise they are a set-it-and-forget-it crop. And once you’ve tasted a garden-grown potato you’ll be hooked!

### Spinach

Lettuce is often the go-to when it comes to leafy garden greens, but spinach is truly a powerhouse plant. It is hardier than lettuce and contains more vitamins and nutrients. It's also more versatile in the kitchen- you can grow lots of small spinach plants for tender ‘baby spinach’ that can be regularly plucked for fresh salads. Or you can let the plants grow larger for more substantial leaves that can be cooked or frozen. Like lettuce, spinach can be prone to bolting so you’ll want to consider succession planting for ongoing harvests. If you're tight on space and looking to add some greens, you may want to swap spinach into the rotation!

### Turnip

Thinking about turnip might conjure up memories of a mushy puree served exclusively over the holidays. But you might not know that there are some types of turnips that are deliciously sweet, crispy, and can be eaten raw. ‘Hakurei turnips’ are a farmer’s market specialty crop that are super easy to grow. They look like a large white radish, and are grown similarly to radishes, but the taste is fresh and juicy without any of the signature radish kick. The turnip greens are also excellent for stir-frying.

### Winter Squash

Summer squash such as zucchini often dominates in the summer garden, but winter squashes that can be stored such as butternut, acorn, and spaghetti squash are highly versatile crops that let you enjoy your garden harvest well into the winter months when other crops have long since been consumed. The term ‘winter squash’ seems to suggest something to be planted in the fall, they are in fact heat-loving plants that grow through the summer months. While winter squash plants are large and ramble-y, just one healthy plant can produce several squashes. And if space is a consideration, you can always trellis them vertically to free up space on the ground.

### Raspberries

When it comes to growing berries, while many gardeners jump straight into growing strawberries, raspberries are arguably the easiest berries to grow. And considering how expensive a small pint can be, they are well worth it! Raspberry bushes tend to spread over time so you will need to consider how to contain them, and they do need some pruning each year to maximize the harvest, but other than that they are easy-peasy!

### Rhubarb

Rhubarb might feel like an old-timey plant, but they have been a cornerstone of the home garden for a reason. Once they are up and growing, rhubarb plants are hardy as anything and require almost no maintenance - with some plants living on for several decades. And while the stalks are often processed for baking and preserving, there’s nothing easier than chopping up some rhubarb and freezing it to be able to make a delicious rhubarb crisp in the dead of winter. If you have a spot anywhere in your yard that gets sun exposure- even at the side of your house, mixed in with the landscaping- stick a rhubarb plant in there for a harvest that couldn’t be simpler!

You don’t need to give up all your garden go-tos to make way for new plants- just experiment with one or two unusual additions to expand your gardening repertoire!
