Most gardeners are aware of the critical role that pollinators play in the garden, in agriculture, and in the natural world. What might not be as widely known is that there are other kinds of beneficial insects in the garden, namely predatory and parasitic insects that can help to control pest populations! Some beneficial predatory insects can look quite threatening, so it’s important not to just squish (or spray) any scary-looking bug. Also, it's often the younger larval and nymph stages that chow down on (or parasitize) pesky garden pests. At these young stages they often look nothing like the adult insects that we're familiar with. Take for example a lady beetle (ladybug) larva, which looks quite gnarly:

These larva can actually eat more aphids than adult lady beetles! So, when in doubt, research first before concluding that something is a pest.

To help identify the 'good guys' in the garden and which pests they target we've compiled a list of some common beneficial insects:

# Beneficial Predatory and Parasitic Insects

## Aphid midges

Scientific name: *Aphidoletes aphidimyza |* [Click to search on Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=Aphidoletes+aphidimyza)

Aphid midge larvae feed on around 60 different types of aphids, as well as other soft bodied insects. A single larva can eat from 3 to 50 aphids per day! Adult aphid midges are not predatory; they consume pollen and ‘honeydew’ (sugary secretions). Adults tend to be active at night so you might not detect their presence in your garden.

## Big-eyed bugs

Scientific name: *Geocoris spp. |* [Click to search on Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=big-eyed+bug)

Big-eyed bug adults and nymphs both feed on a variety of small pests including flea beetles, mites, aphids, whiteflies, and others. They tend to be found in low-growing plants, at the base of plants, and hiding in leaf litter on the ground. Big-eyed bugs are also known to feed on plants particularly when prey are scarce, but they rarely cause substantial damage.

## Damsel bugs

Scientific name: *Nabis spp.*

Not to be confused with damselflies (coming up next!) damsel bugs prey on many types of insects and caterpillars at various life stages, including: aphids, spider mites, moth eggs, corn earworms, European corn borer, imported cabbageworms, some armyworms, some beetles, thrips, leafhoppers, tarnished plant bug nymphs, asparagus beetles, and Colorado potato beetle eggs and nymphs. Damsel bugs can also feed on plants but they do not cause plant injury.

## Dragonflies and damselflies

Scientific name: Order ‘Odonata’

Dragonflies and their smaller relatives, damselflies, eat prolific quantities of mosquitoes, gnats, moths, and practically any small flying insects. While they are considered beneficial in the garden and the ecosystem, larger dragonflies can sometimes prey on other beneficial insects like butterflies, bees, and smaller dragonflies. Dragonflies and damselflies tend to live near wetlands, ponds, and streams, so adding water features to your garden may help attract them.

## Ground beetles

Scientific name: *Agonum* spp., *Calosoma* spp., *Scaphinotus* spp., and others | [Click to search on Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=ground+beetles)

Ground beetles are nocturnal predators that prey on soil-dwelling pests such as wireworms, armyworms, cutworms, maggots, slugs, and snails, as well as aphids, cucumber beetle and Colorado potato beetle larvae. There are many different genera and species of ground beetles. Some types will feed on plant tissue and seeds- they can put a considerable dent in the weed seed bank! Ground beetles prefer moist environments and they like to hide out in garden mulch. 

## Syrphid flies (hoverflies, flower flies)

Syrphid flies are also known as hoverflies or flower flies. They look somewhat like a bee crossed with a fly, although they do not sting. The adults can be found, as the names suggest, hovering around flowers to collect pollen and nectar. Adult syrphid flies are effective- and often underappreciated- pollinators. Syrphid fly larvae on the other hand are voracious predators. They eat pests such as aphids, mealybugs, thrips, leafhoppers, scale insects, mites, and even some caterpillars.
