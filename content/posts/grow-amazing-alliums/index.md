Alliums, that is plants belonging to the onion family, are a must-have in your garden! They are low-maintenance, resistant to many pests and diseases, and super-versatile in the kitchen. Alliums are not limited to only onions though- chives, leeks, and garlic are also alliums! Each of these crops has unique characteristics which we’ll cover in this article.

### Onions (and Shallots)

Onions are what most people think of when they think of alliums. Onions can be sub-categorized as ‘bulbing onions’ including varieties of yellow onion, white onion, and red (purple) onion, ‘bunching onions’ such as green onions, and shallots which are small and mild. While green onions are relatively easy-peasy to grow, when it comes to growing bulbing onions successfully, you will need to determine whether to grow ‘long-day’ onions, ‘short-day’ onions, or ‘day neutral’ onions. This depends on where you live and how long the days are- if you grow the wrong type of onion for your area, the onion will not bulb up.

Onions can be grown from ‘sets’ which are essentially young pre-started onions that you can purchase, or from seeds. Many gardeners find sets easy and you do get a bit of a head start, however if you’re comfortable starting seeds indoors give onion seeds a try- they are fairly easy too!

Onions can be planted before your last frost date. They should be planted about x inches deep into loose soil that will allow the bulbs to expand. Use an all-purpose fertilizer, and be sure your soil has enough sulfur- onions need sulfur to develop flavor.

Some gardeners advocate “spooning” onions - scooping some soil out from around the bulb to encourage it to grow outwards. This is not necessary, but if you have the time go for it!  Onions are ready to harvest once the leaves start to fall over and dry out. Pull the onions out of the ground and allow them to dry completely before snipping the tops and bottoms off and wiping off any surface dirt. Onions that are cured can store for several months.

### Chives

If you’re looking for the easiest possible allium to grow, be sure to plant some chives! Chives are cold-tolerant perennial herbs that keep coming back year after year. Chives can be grown from seeds or purchased as transplants (or if you have a neighbor growing chives, ask if you could divide them up and take a small bunch home!)

Chives are best planted in the spring. They tend to grow best in cooler temperatures with some extra moisture- you may find their growth stalls in the summer heat only to come back again in fall. To harvest chives, simply use garden snips or scissors to trim off some leaves to use in salads or as a garnish. Chives have a very mild onion flavor- similar to green onion but more subtle. Later in spring chives will produce beautiful flowers- these are edible too and have the same mild oniony-flavor– or you can leave them for the bees!

### Leeks

Leeks are not as common as some of their allium family relatives, but if you haven’t tried them you have to give them a go! They are surprisingly very easy to grow and have a unique, mild sweet flavor that you just can’t find in other alliums. Leeks tend to be an expensive gourmet item in the produce aisle but you can grow them at home for next to nothing! Like onions, leeks can be grown from seeds or sets. When using leeks in the kitchen, usually long white stems are prized whereas the green parts are either discarded or used for soup stock. To get the desired white stems they need to be ‘blanched’ - that is covered and protected from the sun. There are two primary ways you can achieve this: first is by using a tool called a “dibbler” to make deep holes up to 4” into the soil - into which you can insert the tiny leek plants. You can also add mulch on top of the soil as the leeks grow to further protect the stems from the sun.

One thing to note about leeks is they take a long time to grow- plan your garden space accordingly (in Planter!) and be sure to plant them with enough time to mature.
