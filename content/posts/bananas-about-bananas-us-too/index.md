Bananas. Nearly everyone knows what they are, and they can commonly be found in supermarkets. These long yellow fruits go great in smoothies, or ice-cream, or salads, or on their own! Banana’s grow in a variety of tropical climates, and can be an awesome fruit to grow.

### **1) Plant description**

The Banana plant is a tropical and subtropical plant that has up to 83 variations! With large green leaves that can grow up to two meters (6.6 feet), and thick stems, these plants are most recognisable by their broad leaves and bright fruit. The banana plant, to little surprise, produces bananas – curved fruits that yellow when ripen, with an outer skin the needs to be removed prior to consumption.

### **2) Finding seeds**

You may have seen that supermarket bananas have little black dots inside the fruit that look somewhat like seeds – but the seeds from these cultivated varieties are often infertile, and will not sprout. Instead, I would recommend you go to your nearest plant nursery and have a look for banana seeds, for example the *Musa acuminata* and *Musa balbisiana varieties.*

 

### **3)  Planting**

The first thing to acknowledge when planting bananas is that they will require **space**. Height, width, these plants need room to grow. Whilst the sapling can be grown in smaller pots and then transferred, the eventual plant will need room, much like a small tree.

Once you have your banana seeds, encourage them to grow by soaking them in warm water, then planting them into soil. Soil with organic matter along with some sandy and/or loamy soil is preferable.

Plant the seeds 0.6cm (1/4 inch). Keep the soil moist, but don’t drown the plant – too much water will cause your plant and sprout to rot.

 

### **4) Watering**

Keep the soil moist – depending on your climate, I would recommend between once to three times a week. Please don’t drown your plant! While the banana doesn’t do great without water (and are in fact quite sensitive to drought) they also don’t do well if the ground around them is constantly soaked.

 

### **5) Pollinating**

Pollination isn’t actually necessary for bananas to produce fruit! Most varieties can reproduce asexually. Isn’t that awesome?!

 

### **6)** **Stages of growth**

Depending on variety, banana seeds can take between two weeks to over two months. I would recommend you research your chosen variety before planting, so you have some idea of what to expect.

The banana plant has three main stages – growth (6 months), flowering (3 months), and fruiting (3 months).

Instead of a trunk, the banana plant will actually form a pseudo-stem, made from tightly bound overlapping leaves that support the plant. During this stage of original growth, it is best to check your plant regularly to ensure it does not get leaf spots.

Banana plants begin to flower when the plant is about 9 months old, however it can take longer if you live in a cooler climate! So don’t worry if your plant doesn’t flower right on the nine month mark. The flowers are covered by large purple bract that it gradually sheds as it matures.

The final stage is fruit production – this tends to take three months from the flowers for the fruit to mature. The fruit grows in large bunches. Banana plants can produce over 200 fruit in one season!

 

### **7)   Knowing when they’re ripe**

Bananas will certainly tell you when they’re ripe – unripe bananas are a strong green, and very firm. Ripe bananas are often softer, and the skin changes to a strong yellow.

 

### **8) Harvesting seeds for next time**

As I said, your banana likely reproduces asexually! Because of this, it will continue setting new fruit each year, along with new plant segments to replace the dying ones. However, if you truly wish to harvest your banana seeds, simply cut open your banana, carefully pick out the seeds, and place them in a dry piece of paper towel to dry out. Once they are fully dry, place them in the fridge for 24 hours to undergo a ‘winter cycle’, and ensure that they stay dormant until you need. After this, you can store them with all your other plants!

 

### **9)  What can you use Bananas in?**

In all honesty, banana’s can be used in a massive range of dishes. From ice-cream to salads, to just eating as in, bananas are an awesome addition to your kitchen!

Happy Gardening!
